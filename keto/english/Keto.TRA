@0    = ~So, there I was. Just humming a tune to keep my bravery, while the light of my torch flickered in the stifling darkness of the Firewine ruins.~ [FWKETO50]
@1    = ~The air--still. Quiet as death, aye, and with an... with an... antiquated stench, though not as much stench as this beer!~ [FWKETO51]
@2    = ~My good talespinner, that brew is the finest made of its kind, fermented in--~
@3    = ~Right, and no doubt you have at least six different flavors, aye, Samuel?~
@4    = ~(hiccup) By the end of the week, I may've tried them all, too, heh...~
@5    = ~Oh, what a pity. I know her; a bit feisty, but, under ideal conditions, she tells a story to lead all the Realms on a journey to most magical and mysterious places.~
@6    = ~Unfortunate that she invariably spoils the entire effect by being half-dead on wine while she's doing it.~
@7    = ~Ehh... where was I? Damn, whisked out of memory with just one glance at the wine rack...~
@8    = ~Oh! The Firewine ruins!~
@9    = ~Aye, so there I was! In the cold, dark heart of a... labyrinthine tomb, stepping forth. Full confidence, of course, despite the kobolds surrounding me, and... and...~
@10   = ~Oh, aye, aye. Aye... there I was!~
@11   = ~Ha! She's been "there" a dozen times, now!~
@12   = ~And, suddenly, beady little red eyes, all around me! Surrounding me on all sides! And from the black came a chorus of hellish cries as dozens of the foul, mangy beasts leapt from their hiding spaces to confront me!~
@13   = ~Hmmph. I hardly think a pack of kobolds deserves such... dramatics. Does she really think anyone would find *that* a rousing tale?~
@14   = ~Teeth glimmering in dripping jaws, swords and bows held at ready! And... and...~
@15   = ~Sounds like SHE could use one of my Flasher Master Bruiser Mates. Would have had that kobold problem running in a blinded, barking, whimpering series of circles. Actually, that reminds me of the time Ma Jansen was trying to gather us children into the house for dinner, but we were too busy playing "Hide the Turnip." She always did hate it when we let our turnip stew get cold, so she--~
@16   = ~And what else could our poor, poor heroine do, in such a situation?~
@17   = ~Hurling curses upon their heads, I flung my torch into the face of their leader, and dashed for the exit, all the way the beasts nipping at my heels. But, once in the full glory of the light of day, the creatures slinked back into their lair--~
@18   = ~Fleeing from such little foes? Size is not the only measure, for surely Boo is a worthy adversary, but kobolds should not be so feared! Poor little bard!~
@19   = ~<CHARNAME>, we need to give her a bigger sword!~
@20   = ~Wait, you ran away from a batch of *kobolds*? What kind of intrepid adventurer are you?~
@21   = ~Well, they may be small, but there WERE a lot of them... um... heh...~
@22   = ~What are you saying there, bard? That just because kobolds are small, they must be stupid, snarling beasts, too? Calling me a kobold, huh? I think you are! Well, look here--~
@23   = ~Oh, they're not being very nice... she was only trying to tell a story!~
@24   = ~(sniff) All this talk of kobolds and barbarian ruins... honestly, if not for the wines here, I would NEVER subject myself to such company.~
@25   = ~But, as is, another round, Thunderburp, if you will.~
@26   = ~You know, for a tavern with a playhouse under it, it's one hell of an unappreciative audience. At least the drinking's good.~
@27   = ~While not exactly the most valorous tale ever told, she has been at least as far north as the Firewine. She also seems to have a name for herself. Perhaps she has more scintillating tales in her yet, <CHARNAME>.~
@28   = ~Oh, finally dragged yourself in, I see. I was just beginning to celebrate being rid of you at last.~ [FWKETO52]
@29   = ~And deny myself your incomparable charm, Keto? Perish the thought. 'Tis good to know I never stray far from your thoughts, my robin, even if your welcome is not as warm as I could have hoped.~
@30   = ~Oh, spare me. I'm finished with you. Believe me, Haer'Dalis, in my thoughts, your name will never be far from an accompanying curse.~
@31   = ~And why are you tormenting these folk with your toxic presence? Raelis finally get sick of you?~
@32   = ~Miss Raelis has gone on, Keto, a fact which you may have known yourself were you not blinded by spirits and stories. These stalwart hounds have taken me in willingly, exhibiting considerably more refinement than might be found in some.~
@33   = ~What, the troupe finally got chased off? What a tragedy. So who have you managed to force yourself upon, Haer'Dalis?~
@34   = ~Try asking <PRO_HIMHER> yourself; my raven has a tongue <PRO_HESHE> is able to use.~
@35   = ~Far from it. She hired these good hounds to pluck me from captivity, and they have acquitted themselves most admirably. We have returned to the nest to deliver an object of importance to her--~
@36   = ~Oh, for gods' sake, Haer'Dalis, I don't care. So who have you conned into doing your work for you?~
@37   = ~You have shriveled to become quite a prickly bird, haven't you, my wild gosling? You may ask after my raven's business if you wish, but I'll not speak for <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@38   = ~She awaits my return with a particular object, but if she has grown less fond of my company, she has given no sign subtle or explicit. In fact, she hired yonder ravens to fetch me from captivity. Not all share your... peculiar resentment, my robin.~
@39   = ~Don't call me that. I don't have any feathers.~
@40   = ~If not feathers, then what ruffles on yonder caressable neck?~
@41   = ~Don't nudge your luck. So who have you tricked into helping you this time?~
@42   = ~I can tell you my raven accepted this sparrow of <PRO_HISHER> own will. I would play any part or play them all, but speak for my raven, I shall not do. I suggest you *ask*.~
@43   = ~Fine, then.~
@44   = ~Hey, stranger, are you here to heckle a defenseless bard, or just trying to get to the bar?~ [FWKETO53]
@45   = ~Just going right on to the bar, actually.~
@46   = ~I just wanted to talk to someone with an interesting story.~
@47   = ~Heckle? That pathetic yarn wasn't worth the effort of insulting.~
@48   = ~With a little more sobriety and a more pliable audience, that would not have been such a bad little tale. Is it true?~
@49   = ~Neither. I am looking for information, as a matter of fact..~
@50   = ~I was curious as to why you ran screaming from a couple of kobolds, and who taught you how to fight. It might not be too late to get a refund.~
@51   = ~Cute story. Can I buy you a drink?~
@52   = ~Ah, don't be so hard on yourself, and don't let the company get to you; if the road of the bard were an easy one, none of us would ever travel it.~
@53   = ~Suit yourself.~
@54   = ~Oh, guess I should move...~
@55   = ~And you aren't worth the effort of talking to, but you don't see me clamming up and throwing a drink in your face, aye?~
@56   = ~Eh, move along, I have thoughts to drown...~
@57   = ~Thanks for the vote of confidence. Aye, the tale, such as it is, is true enough. Made a drop-off in the ruins on my way to Baldur's Gate a bit of time ago; damned kobolds sent me scurrying quick, though.~
@58   = ~Really? I was in Baldur's Gate until just recently, myself.~
@59   = ~You seem a hardy type, though. It looks like you might have seen a few scraps. Couldn't you have fought?~
@60   = ~Yeah, you have to be wary of those kobolds. Dragons and liches lie prostrate when facing the yapping beasts, they do.~
@61   = ~I don't exactly have fond memories of the little fiends myself. What brought you to Athkatla?~
@62   = ~Well, if I may offer a critique... perhaps flight isn't the best story fodder? Tales of battle and tragedy and victory and loss! That's what captures the attention of the average patron.~
@63   = ~Well, aren't you just the charmer. Good timing, too--my mug was getting dry.~
@64   = ~Oh, that's all right. This one will last me a while yet.~
@65   = ~Ah, a kindred spirit, I see. You are in the right, for certain; a thankless road the one I travel tends to be. Nothing but table scraps for pay, and frequent subjection to buffoons who wouldn't know a decent story if it bit them on the nose. (Which I've very nearly had to do before to get their attention, heh.)~
@66   = ~I admire your tenacity. Though, perhaps to prevent unpleasant heckling, you should change your stock a little? Tales of battle and tragedy stir the heart more than tales of cowa--er. Caution.~
@67   = ~You tell a good story, in your own unique way.~
@68   = ~Maybe there is a reason you do not enjoy a good reception. You seem a touch arrogant.~
@69   = ~No doubt, it's a difficult job, isn't it? So, might I buy you a drink?~
@70   = ~Is there something I can do for you?~
@71   = ~Actually, I'm curious as to how I can persuade you to come upstairs with me?~
@72   = ~Who are you?~
@73   = ~Have you ever heard of a mage called Irenicus?~
@74   = ~Do you happen to know anything of the Shadow Thieves, or of this guild war I have heard about?~
@75   = ~Do you have any information on the Cowled Wizards, such as where they might take prisoners? A friend of mine was taken by them.~
@76   = ~What do you know of the murders in this district?~
@77   = ~Do you have any other tales to share?~
@78   = ~Maybe you've heard of <CHARNAME>? Hero of the Sword Coast, or somesuch, and the only thing the folk at the Gate could talk about for weeks.~
@79   = ~Yes, I'm somewhat familiar with <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@80   = ~Oh? Do continue. I've not heard this tale.~
@81   = ~Well, actually, that would be me.~
@82   = ~Yes, I've heard of <PRO_HIMHER>. I'd like to ask something, though.~
@83   = ~Oh, I suppose I could have. That's dangerous though. I have a thing about pain--I don't like it.~
@84   = ~Just like any coward.~
@85   = ~Most reasonable-minded folk don't. But tales of expeditious retreat are never going to draw as much attention as those of war, tragedy, and the like.~
@86   = ~Understandable. Could I ask you a few things, though, so long as I am here?~
@87   = ~No need for all that, I think. I'm just one little bard. Only so much I can do.~
@88   = ~True enough, I suppose, but still--kobolds! Ah well. Do you have any other daring tales of bravery and might to share?~
@89   = ~Well, if kobolds are above you, maybe a few questions are within your capabilities?~
@90   = ~Then I certainly hope you're able to get out of my way to the bar.~
@91   = ~I see. I'll be going now.~
@92   = ~Oh, I agree, but here's the thing--fighting equals pain, which I don't like at all, and about the only tragedy that could fall would be squarely upon my head. And, well, with me out of the picture, who would come back and relate valorous accounts of my downfall?~
@93   = ~No, I'll stick with my daring escapes, and if no one else finds them daring--well, ah, I guess they don't. Makes it damn hard to support my wine.~
@94   = ~If I provide a little of that support, maybe I could ask a question or two?~
@95   = ~So, you're a coward.~
@96   = ~Yes, I can see that being very inconvenient for you.~
@97   = ~I wish I could foresee larger audiences for you. But the person you have to please, above all, is yourself. As one bard to another, though, perhaps I could ask a few things?~
@98   = ~Arrogant?! Oh, no! Just a little bitter, I suppose. I couldn't draw a crowd if my life depended upon it--and, thankfully, it doesn't. Drinks do, though. Honestly, people think that simply because I poke my head into Death's door rather than stride in and take up residence that I'm somehow less of an adventurer.~
@99   = ~I've been on the road for... well, years, and still I haven't moved beyond the rank of vagabond.~
@100  = ~My apologies. I may have been a little quick to judge. Who are you, exactly?~
@101  = ~From what I've seen, that's an overstatement. A keg of ale provides hours more entertainment than your cowardly tales ever could.~
@102  = ~I can sympathize, actually. I don't recieve as good a reception as I would like. It's "slay this," "fetch this," "find this," "rescue this," and the list goes on, but no one ever asks for a song, or a bit of poetry. Ah, the lot of a bard is a hard one.~
@103  = ~Hmm... normally you'd have earned yourself a slap, my lord, but... no, I don't think so.~
@104  = ~Hmmph. I'm drunk, but hardly THAT drunk.~
@105  = ~I hope you enjoy your own company, because it'll be all you'll get tonight; I'll be buying my own drinks.~
@106  = ~Uh, no, sorry, not interested. You look a bit too much like me, know what I'm saying?~
@107  = ~Name's Keto Riven, a bard of at least middling talent, and I've seen the front door of just about every dungeon along the Sword Coast.~
@108  = ~Well met, Keto. I am <CHARNAME>. Tell me, is there anything that would get you past the front door occasionally?~
@109  = ~How useless. No wonder your stories attract nothing but jeers.~
@110  = ~Good to know you. May I ask some other things?~
@111  = ~Irenicus? What kind of idiotic name is that? But, no, never heard of him. Doesn't sound particularly pleasant though, does he? Anything else?~
@112  = ~No, I wll be moving on now. Thanks for your help.~
@113  = ~I would like to ask you something else.~
@114  = ~The Shadow Thieves go to great lengths to keep themselves to the--well, shadows--and what I can tell you, you probably already know.~
@115  = ~They pull the strings in Athkatla, and if they decide to take action that goes against the Cowled Wizards... well, there isn't much that could be done to stop them.~
@116  = ~I know they have a presence in the Docks District, and that they've been coping with a rival guild recently appeared. Pretty strange, though, as it seems like they're trying to create carnage in the ranks rather than concentrating on bringing down the Shadow Thieves.~
@117  = ~Judging from what I've seen that's spilled into the streets, that is. Make of it what you will. Anything else?~
@118  = ~You know, for being intoxicated, you are fairly eloquent.~
@119  = ~No, I will be moving on now. Thank you for the help.~
@120  = ~A friend taken for breaking the "magic is bad" rule around here, eh? Well, I can almost guarantee they're not in Athkatla anymore, that's for sure. The last thing any city needs is a bunch of angry, magic-flinging prisoners.~
@121  = ~I couldn't tell you where they'd send your friend, but there are forces in Athkatla that can no doubt ferret out such information right under their Cowled noses. And this IS the City of Coin; if you've the gold, you can find someone to do whatever you need.~
@122  = ~Considering the odor on your breath, I am surprised you still stand, let alone provide coherent information.~
@123  = ~I will be moving along now, thanks for the help.~
@124  = ~Aye, nasty business the whole thing is, people being stripped of skin. I hear it's a clean job, too, nothing you'd expect from a beast.~
@125  = ~Now that I think about it, there are legends about skinless beasts stealing, literally, the backs off their victims.~
@126  = ~Having one loose in Athkatla, though, just seems a reach. Maybe he's just a freak that makes dresses out of 'em. Who knows?~
@127  = ~I think it's just another insane murderer on the loose, at least until I get my hands on him. Could I ask you some other things?~
@128  = ~That gives me something to think on. Count on a bard to see an overlooked angle. May I ask something else?~
@129  = ~Wow. Even after all that beer, you can still remember this stuff?~
@130  = ~Thanks for the help, but I will be moving on, now.~
@131  = ~Oh... REALLY? I mean... wow. This is great!~
@132  = ~You know, really, you were all the talk at the Gate. Why'd you leave? Oh, forget about that, just stop standing and sit down to talk with me.~
@133  = ~Honestly, it's rare that I ever get this far in a conversation with someone of importance--and I don't consider Lord Clerk or whatever his name is anything of the sort. Is... is there anything I can do for you?~
@134  = ~(laugh) Slow down! It's nice to have admirers, though. Perhaps I could ask a few questions?~
@135  = ~Oh, do stop fawning. It doesn't become you. I was actually just wondering if there was something I could do for YOU.~
@136  = ~Well, that was unexpected. Maybe I could do something for you, instead?~
@137  = ~Oh. Yeah, right.~
@138  = ~That's not a very funny trick, you know. Sure, <CHARNAME> just wanders in here and starts talking to ME of all people. I can't even get a decent reception at a fleabitten dive.~
@139  = ~Guess I can't blame you, though. At heart I guess we all want to be something better than what we are.~
@140  = ~Aye, you see the right of it. A busy life you seem to lead, though, on the way to adventure and glory. You know... you remind me of...~
@141  = ~Oh, good Tymora! Are you <CHARNAME>?~
@142  = ~Yes, I am <PRO_HESHE>.~
@143  = ~No. I have no idea what you're talking about. Actually, I think I'm going to get a drink, now.~
@144  = ~That I am. You know that name?~
@145  = ~The same <CHARNAME> that halted the threat of war between Amn and Baldur's Gate? The one I heard so much about when I went up there?~
@146  = ~Yes, that was me.~
@147  = ~No, just a coincidence. I think I'll go on, now, actually.~
@148  = ~Same reasons why anyone travels--either for money or adventure, or due to stupidity or inertia. I'm a combination of all of them, I think.~
@149  = ~Perhaps I could ask some questions, then?~
@150  = ~True enough. Pleasant talking to you, good journey.~
@151  = ~An interesting mix. May I know who you are?~
@152  = ~Eh, well, when your primary talents are drinking and talking too much, it's only a matter of time before you make an attempt at doing both of them, but I can't drink as much when I'm talking, and I can't talk as much when I'm drinking, so it's a balanced state of being, I think.~
@153  = ~You ARE a quirky one. Could I ask you some other questions?~
@154  = ~If this is you LESS talkative, I would hate to see you sober.~
@155  = ~I will be heading off, now. I think I need a stiff drink myself after all this...~
@156  = ~You should certainly be, ah, proud of your talent. Another round to bend your ear further?~
@157  = ~It happens.~
@158  = ~Really. I'll be heading off now.~
@159  = ~Alright, then, strangeling. Could I beg further inquiries?~
@160  = ~Eh, there was some talk that <PRO_HESHE> was actually a... well, not a born hero, at any rate. I'd prefer to see for myself, though. At least, when I can screw up the courage to leave the bar.~
@161  = ~Hmm. You know, that was actually me.~
@162  = ~Not a born hero? I find that rather insulting!~
@163  = ~Interesting. I think I will be heading off, now, though.~
@164  = ~Rather... ohhh, no! You're <CHARNAME>?~
@165  = ~Well.. you know, it'd be really amazing if... oh, no, I couldn't ask.~
@166  = ~No, no, it's quite all right, a wonder meeting you, to be sure, but this poor young thing will just mull over her drink and continue dreaming of the chance to prove herself worthy of being called a bard and not just a warbling traveller.~
@167  = ~Aye, just go on to the bar, a merry time to you.~
@168  = ~Very well. Good <DAYNIGHT>.~
@169  = ~Such histrionics. You really ARE a performer, aren't you? You may join me, if you wish.~
@170  = ~Just out of curiosity... would you like to accompany me?~
@171  = ~Oh... ah... all right. Aye, that's what I said, right? Right, go on, I'll be quiet.~
@172  = ~You'd let me? Wonderful! I've got a new sword, so I'm all ready to go. Oh, wait, just got to buy a bottle of wine for the road.~
@173  = ~...There. Shall we be off, <CHARNAME>? My fingers are itching already to write of our grand escapes from greater dangers than I have faced!~
@174  = ~You are welcome to the party. But we do not escape from danger. Danger will be scrambling to escape from us.~
@175  = ~Glad to have you, Keto, but there is one thing you should know--I'm going after a mage called Irenicus, and there will be no running away when I face him.~
@176  = ~A rescue mission is actually to be the first venture. A friend of mine is held captive by the Cowled Wizards, and I will not abandon her.~
@177  = ~Nice to have you. Let's go.~
@178  = ~That IS a change of pace. I'll do my best; I'm generally quite brave until the blood starts flowing. Mine, that is.~
@179  = ~That doesn't sound just slightly dangerous. I try not to meddle in the affairs of mages, but you're the one running the show--if this Irenicus is paramount to your goals, then I'll help as best I can.~
@180  = ~As long as we don't end up sharing space in whatever cell she's in, I'll come along and help. Definitely good to know you aren't one to abandon friends, though. Forebodes well for me.~
@181  = ~Oh... I'm a wee bit tippled at the moment, but I remember you. I think. Whatcha need?~ [FWKETO54]
@182  = ~Some additional help, and you're as good as any. Want to come along?~
@183  = ~Nothing, really, just stopping in for a little to drink.~
@184  = ~I was wondering if you'd like to join with us.~
@185  = ~I do have to support my liquor, you know; what kind of tale are you offering to have me along?~
@186  = ~This is silly. Never mind. I'll find someone else who's not as choosy.~
@187  = ~My life is one long, rich tapestry. You can weave it. Or something. Just come along.~
@188  = ~A tale of the hunt and destruction of a mage known as Irenicus; the battle where I at last overcome him should be impressive, to say the least. Daring enough for you?~
@189  = ~How about the rescue of an abducted friend, whisked away by the Cowled Wizards? A story of bravery and honor and such. Good enough?~
@190  = ~A grand story leading to the epic battle between my stalwart company and the hideous Irenicus, a mage worthy of nothing but loathing and extensive pain. The search, the hunt, and the final conflict--surely these are enough to bring even the most indifferent audience to the edge of their seat, hmm, my fellow talespinner?~
@191  = ~The desperate story of our heroes' valiant search for a lost comrade, even through the deceit of Athkatla, piercing the darkness to find the truth and affect a grand rescue for her! Loyalty at its finest, and such a tale as to tear up the eyes of the most surly merchant.~
@192  = ~This isn't a game, girl. If you want something better than a bottle and a cold audience, you'll come with me.~
@193  = ~Simple. Direct. To the point. I like it enough.~
@194  = ~I'm yours. Unless the drinking's better elsewhere, heh.~
@195  = ~Oh, aye, it's that easy, is it?~
@196  = ~Hells. The audience IS rather dull. I'll come.~
@197  = ~Not exactly inspiring, but good enough. Sure, I was bored anyway. Just let me buy some wine for the road, and I'm ready to head out.~
@198  = ~I do admit, from the sound of it, this will definitely be... a change from my past experiences. It should be interesting, nonetheless.~
@199  = ~Wow. Maybe I need to start taking pointers from YOU! Well said, I must say. How could I refuse?~
@200  = ~A bottle of wine for the road, and a last drink of this ale to prepare me for what awaits; the interesting path tends to be the most dangerous one, aye?~
@201  = ~You again? Whatcha need? I have wine to drink.~
@202  = ~I want you to come along.~
@203  = ~I don't need anything from you.~
@204  = ~Ah. Here to heckle, I see.~
@205  = ~Eh, go talk to the dwarf and the halfling suffering from an inferority complex--~
@206  = ~I heard that, bard! Watch it! Just because I'm small doesn't mean I can't--~
@207  = ~--I rest my case. Anyway, I think they'll be much more appreciative of your sense of humor.~
@208  = ~I'm sure someone else around here will better appreciate your sense of humor.~
@209  = ~Remember it clear as yesterday, I do. (Though yesterday is a little bleary sometimes, but that's beside the point.)~ [FWKETO55]
@210  = ~After my flight from the residents of the Firewine, I made my merry, weary way to the Gate and took up a room at the Elfsong. And, in between dodging daggers, swords, and other responses to my attempts at serenading the room with a ballad of expeditious retreat, I picked up on recent occurrences.~
@211  = ~Apparently, the son of one of the Iron Throne leaders, "Sarevok" to what friends he had, was hell-bent to instigate war with Amn. He usurped control of the Iron Throne after killing his own father and his associates, and was intent on having the Grand Dukes assassinated, and wore all that under a charming demeanor that won over the people of the Throne looking for a strong hand.~
@212  = ~Well, apparently this <CHARNAME>--usually just called the Hero of the Sword Coast, but I got a name--not only set things right by solving the iron crisis, but despite numerous assassination attempts and a nasty set-up, rose up and killed Sarevok.~
@213  = ~Well, apparently this <CHARNAME>--usually just called the Heroine of the Sword Coast, but I got a name--not only set things right by solving the iron crisis, but despite numerous assassination attempts and a nasty set-up, rose up and killed Sarevok.~
@214  = ~Damn my luck, <PRO_HESHE> left not just a few days before I arrived. Sure would have liked to have met <PRO_HIMHER>. Then maybe I could regale audiences with the tales of epic adventure that they're so dead-set on hearing.~
@215  = ~Well, actually, I AM <CHARNAME>.~
@216  = ~It would certanily be great to know about such a great hero. Say, ever hear what happened to <PRO_HIMHER>?~
@217  = ~You win some and you lose some, it seems. Well, thank you for the tale, I will be going on now.~
@218  = ~Is that all they said about this hero?~


// FWKetoP

@300  = ~Found you!~
@301  = ~<CHARNAME>, it was unbelievable. I was there, and I don't believe it!~
@302  = ~I didn't win--Prudence was there, you see. Prudence, she just smiles meekly at an innkeep, and they're pleading with her to take their gold and stay forever!~
@303  = ~She's such an exceptional singer that nobody can resist--well, the important part isn't that I didn't win, but who was there.~
@304  = ~<CHARNAME>, my parents were there! In fact, they planned the whole thing! Myles and Grainne O'Fairney. I'm their daughter Cait, or Catriona if you want to be formal. Which of course we don't.~
@305  = ~They gave me my grandmother's old adventuring cloak and some letters I wrote to them when I was travelling with my husband--it's a long story, I wish you would have been there to hear it all.~
@306  = ~But I am absolutely breathless, so why don't we just get moving, hmmm?~
@307  = ~So do I call you Catriona now? Cait? Caitie?~
@308  = ~Why not spend some time with them to bring up more of those memories?~
@309  = ~They seem decent folk. Do you think they would adopt me as well? I could use a change of parentage.~
@310  = ~Fine, fine. Just move.~
@311  = ~My congratulations once again for everything. After you, Keto.~
@312  = ~This is not a good time to rejoin forces, Keto.~
@313  = ~Well! Good to see you, <CHARNAME>. The competition's fast approaching--I can't wait! But I tell you, I feel good about it.~ [FWKETO59]
@314  = ~So good, I want you to go right over to Vincenzo and tell him that your drinks are on me! (Did I just say that?)~
@315  = ~Wish me luck!~
@316  = ~This is... this is just villainy! If you want to live your life this way, fine, but I don't have to help you with it!~ [FWKETO56]
@317  = ~What's this? Decided you don't need a tag-along storyteller after all?~ [FWKETO57]
@318  = ~Sorry, but I need you to go.~
@319  = ~Oh, sorry, my mistake.~
@320  = ~All right. We should team up again in the future, though. Where shall I be if you need me again?~
@321  = ~Go hit one of the bars in Athkatla. We will be sure to find you.~
@322  = ~Just stay here.~
@323  = ~Right. Hmmm. Think I'll be at the Mithrest for a while. Largo owes me money, anyway.~
@324  = ~Oh, good to see you made it back. Happen to have my head with you?~ [FWKETO58]
@325  = ~No, wait, it's right where I left it. Did you want me back in the group?~
@326  = ~That I did. We've adventuring to do!~
@327  = ~No, actually, I do not.~
@328  = ~I don't know. I... I don't think so. "Riven" I can certainly do without, now that I know I've got something better.~
@329  = ~But "Cait" still sounds strange to my ears, it does. Like a song I know I remember but can't recall a single note of. Maybe after the folks call me "our Cait" a few hundred more times, I'll get used to it.~
@330  = ~But between you and me and the adoring masses, it'll be "Keto" for some time, I think.~
@331  = ~There's a big dusty trunk full of memories in my head, <CHARNAME>. Today we cracked it open. If I just dumped it out on the floor, I might lose some of them.~
@332  = ~And... and as much as I know we all love each other, I think the three of us need a little time to get used to this.~
@333  = ~Besides. All that can wait. You can't, <CHARNAME>. Leaving your story now to pick up the pieces of the Girl Who Vanished wouldn't be a very smart move, now would it?~
@334  = ~Do you want the poor people to keel over with exhaustion? One foundling per day's probably quite enough for them, I'd say.~
@335  = ~I'll share the wine, <CHARNAME>, but if you don't mind... this prize, I think I'd like to keep for myself.~
@336  = ~Aye. Well done, Keto. Congratulations, Keto. Glad you got the whole "mystery of your life" thing worked out, Keto.~
@337  = ~Ah well. It's still one hell of a day!~
@338  = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>. Such chivalry. Might be good for both of us to do these competitions more often!~

// BFWKeto

@400  = ~Keto? Keto, there's something I need to speak with you about.~
@401  = ~Of course, Aerie. What can I do?~ [FWKETO60]
@402  = ~I--I know you're only doing what you think best, but I want you to stop interfering with Haer'Dalis and me.~
@403  = ~Aerie, the man's a rat.~
@404  = ~Don't look at me like that. I worry for you, and I won't let you ruin yourself over--~
@405  = ~Don't say those things about him! Y-you don't know how we feel about each other! He has given me more happiness than I have had for years, and taught me things I never knew about myself, and about the world. Why do you insist on interfering with that?~
@406  = ~Because you are my friend and I know what Haer'Dalis does to sweet girls like you. He has nothing good in mind for you, Aerie, trust me!~
@407  = ~Haer'Dalis has taught me drama and philosophy, and new ways of looking at the world... a-and how to love.~
@408  = ~All you have been able to talk about is how you knew him before I did. Is that what this is about, Keto? What is it you want from him now?~
@409  = ~Are you mad? I'd die before I gave him another chance to--~
@410  = ~I see. Y-you're bitter over something over and gone. Please, Keto, do not begrudge us our joy. Why must you try to tear us apart?~
@411  = ~For Tymora's sake, Aerie, I'm trying to protect you! I've been the one hearing the same lies before, and I hoped to save you from them!~
@412  = ~What lies? Haer'Dalis has never lied to me. What did he tell you?~
@413  = ~He won't always be there for you, Aerie.~
@414  = ~A-and did he say he would always be there for you?~
@415  = ~(sigh) No, but Aerie, that's not the point.~
@416  = ~Did you ask him if he would?~
@417  = ~Why won't you even listen to me? I thought we were friends!~
@418  = ~I don't need the friendship of someone who won't let me be happy, or make my own decisions, just because she can't live with hers!~
@419  = ~Aerie! You can't mean that!~
@420  = ~I-I do.~
@421  = ~The natural end of the bond between friends. That which is wound becomes unwound, that which is built, lies in dust.~
@422  = ~Do not look so stricken, Keto, it would have happened eventually.~
@423  = ~Maybe, but bad things happen an awful lot faster with you around.~
@424  = ~You misunderstand me.~
@425  = ~No. I *completely* understand you. That's the whole problem.~
@426  = ~Anomen? Might be the wrong thing to say, but, good luck.~ [FWKETO61]
@427  = ~Keto, luck has nothing to do with whether or not I am judged fit to join the Order's ranks.~
@428  = ~This is not something to be decided on a coin flip or the spin of a wheel--'tis the sum total of my entire *life*.~
@429  = ~Guess I was right about it being the wrong thing to say.~
@430  = ~If it pleases you, my thanks for your friendly blessing, then, though it be of little use to me in this.~
@431  = ~Nonsense. Luck has everything to do with this.~
@432  = ~What?~
@433  = ~If your luck is bad, whatever happens, you'll be unhappy; if it holds, you will go to something greater, where you're meant to be.~
@434  = ~Typical response, coming from you. That could mean anything.~
@435  = ~Aye. Tymora has guided me well.~
@436  = ~As has Helm guided me. I can only hope I have followed as he has taught, and that I will be judged fairly by his servants.~
@437  = ~And you are, now, as ready as you'll ever be, I should think.~
@438  = ~Indeed. Enough talking--let us enter. I am prepared for what awaits.~
@439  = ~Heh. That's what they all say.~
@440  = ~On your feet, Keto. We've a long trail ahead of us, and I'll not have our progress slowed by the recuperation from your excesses.~
@441  = ~Mmmph... just five more minutes...~ [FWKETO62]
@442  = ~Honestly, why <CHARNAME> endures your presence is beyond me. Get up, before I lose my patience with you, bard.~
@443  = ~(yawn) But I'm sleepy...~
@444  = ~Ridiculous girl!~
@445  = ~Laziness is the sole contribution of the undisciplined.~
@446  = ~I'm awake... I think.~
@447  = ~Oh, good morning Anomen. Were you saying something?~
@448  = ~Hmmph. You hear little but the tinkle of the copper that funds your inane chatter.~
@449  = ~You know, Yoshimo, there should be songs about you.~ [FWKETO63]
@450  = ~Who is to say there are not?~
@451  = ~I've been laying here trying and trying to think of one, and I can't.~
@452  = ~So, I suppose I need to write one.~
@453  = ~And what will this ballad say of Yoshimo?~
@454  = ~Hmm... well, there's the time you... well, there was the other day when you...~
@455  = ~All right, maybe I'll tell them of the time you...~
@456  = ~Ach. Ballad of Yoshimo? More like four minutes of silence.~
@457  = ~But it makes it a good beginner's piece, does it not?~
@458  = ~P'feh. You know, there are goblin critiques of elven wines that are easier to understand than you, Yoshimo.~
@459  = ~*That* was fun. But, bah, everything's going to be sore in the morning...~ [FWKETO64]
@460  = ~Despite your rather unrepeatable reactions to the wonder of simple vegetables as of late, I'm going to prove that I'm all heart, except for the bony bits, and give you another chance.~
@461  = ~Try this turnip salve. Rub it into your muscles, and when you wake up you'll feel like the day you were born.~
@462  = ~Oh, great. I was born howling, covered in goo, with a ferocious appetite, no doubt; wouldn't know, I don't exactly remember. Why the Hells would I want to feel like that?~
@463  = ~Hmmph! Well, then, I'll just be taking this turnip salve elsewhere! Enjoy your aching muscles.~
@464  = ~Oh, c'mon Jan, don't get indignant...~
@465  = ~(sniff) It's all right, I'll take my unappreciated inventions and try to give them away elsewhere. After all, it's not as though anyone would actually buy them. I've learned that lesson the hard way, shuffling miserably through the streets, trying to peddle a Flasher here and a jar of salve there, turned away because of the vast prejudice against turnips.~
@466  = ~Jan, you're terrible. Okay, okay, I'll use your salve.~
@467  = ~That'll be fifteen gold.~
@468  = ~Business is business, you know.~
@469  = ~...Now, Keto, hold still. I am almost done brushing.~
@470  = ~No problem. Don't worry about pulling too hard, I've got a tough hea--OWW!!~ [FWKETO65]
@471  = ~Oh, sorry, there is a tangle there...~
@472  = ~No, really?~
@473  = ~Ah, there, it's gone. Now, just need to twist a few locks like this...~
@474  = ~Mmph! I didn't know there would be pain involved!~
@475  = ~Hmm. Perhaps your hair is not used to going that way?~
@476  = ~Apparently not. My scalp's throbbing... oh, never mind, thanks for trying.~
@477  = ~No trouble. We can try again when we have more time and better conditions.~
@478  = ~Eh, no thanks... ow...~
@479  = ~...grnnk?~ [FWKETO66]
@480  = ~Ah, so our tippling storyteller awakens at last.~
@481  = ~Are you in good health?~
@482  = ~You appear a bit green, though that may be the fault of bushes you chose for your bed.~
@483  = ~...Who the hell are you people?~
@484  = ~Sobriety sets in at a glacial pace, I see.~
@485  = ~Oh, dammit. Where's the bottle?~
@486  = ~...Ahh.~
@487  = ~All right, I've come to in stranger circumstances than this; I'm ready to head out, but I'd appreciate some reminders as to who you all are before I'm too far gone to remember.~
@488  = ~This has the makings of a most unique morning.~
@489  = ~...My head... can someone find it?~ [FWKETO67]
@490  = ~And hail to you, Keto.~
@491  = ~I trust you are ready for morning drills?~
@492  = ~Drills...?~
@493  = ~Yes. They sharpen the eye, the reflexes, the mind. I have seen for myself how structure can bring focus to life.~
@494  = ~Observing how you spend your evenings, and how they find you each morning, I am convinced that it is time for drill.~
@495  = ~Uh. What will this consist of?~
@496  = ~An early start. Clean clothes and a sharpened sword every morning. March and combat drill. And healthy, energetic blood flow the whole day.~
@497  = ~Sounds strenuous. Maybe sometime else?~
@498  = ~Sometime else? Young lady, you should consider some regimen--any regimen--to replace the one you find in that bottle.~
@499  = ~What do you suggest? I'm not a warrior, practicing my sword arm. I'm not a mage, seeking the deepest secrets of the arcane. I'm not a priest, praying for wisdom from the divine.~
@500  = ~I am what I am--an adventurer--and at this moment, I'm an adventurer with a headache.~
@501  = ~Precisely.~
@502  = ~Sir! Good morning, sir! Your armor is properly shiny and ready for wear, I trust, sir?~ [FWKETO68]
@503  = ~...So it is. Did you do that, Keto?~
@504  = ~Sir, aye sir! A good, strong breakfast prepared for you as well, sir!~
@505  = ~Is that edible?~
@506  = ~I've made it to the specifications described by the soldiers I've spoken with, sir.~
@507  = ~I suppose that is answer enough.~
@508  = ~Keto?~
@509  = ~Sir! Your orders, sir?~
@510  = ~Stop calling me "sir."~
@511  = ~Aye, madam!~
@512  = ~(sigh) What IS this about? If this is a joke, I don't believe I see the humor.~
@513  = ~Merely following the specifications you've deemed "appropriate" for me to live a proper life, Keldorn.~
@514  = ~Ah. You are mocking me.~
@515  = ~Just trying to prove a point, actually.~
@516  = ~Do you think that parading around doing ridiculous, unnecessary tasks in an inaccurate parody of squiredom is what I was suggesting, Keto?~
@517  = ~Further, do you truly believe that making a joke out of my attempts to help you best expresses your point?~
@518  = ~The thought crossed my mind, aye.~
@519  = ~Keto, for your sake, mine, and that of this party, aspire to be of more use and better company than a rank initiate.~
@520  = ~I had never hoped to have occasion to utter these words outside my home: act your age, child.~
@521  = ~We just *had* to rescue you, damn my luck. I was beginning to celebrate being rid of you at last.~ [FWKETOZ2]
@522  = ~And deny myself your incomparable charm, Keto? Perish the thought. 'Tis good to know I never stray far from your thoughts, my robin, even if your welcome is not as warm as I could have hoped.~
@523  = ~Oh, spare me. I'm finished with you. Believe me, Haer'Dalis, in my thoughts, your name will never be far from an accompanying curse.~
@524  = ~And why are you tormenting these folk with your toxic presence?~
@525  = ~You have shriveled to become quite a prickly bird, haven't you, my wild gosling? You may ask after my raven's business if you wish, but I'll not speak for <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@526  = ~Raelis awaits my return with a particular object. Perhaps I shall venture on with her, if that is to be the way of things. If she has grown less fond of my company, perhaps I shall be permitted to linger.~
@527  = ~Not all share your... peculiar resentment, my robin.~
@528  = ~Don't call me that. I don't have any feathers.~
@529  = ~If not feathers, then what ruffles on yonder caressable neck?~
@530  = ~Don't nudge your luck.~
@531  = ~Ahhh, the sounds and smells of home.~ [FWKETO69]
@532  = ~If you'll pardon me interrupting your thoughts, would you mind sharing a drink and sitting with me for a moment?~ [FWKETO70]
@533  = ~Sure, I needed the break anyway. What is on your mind?~
@534  = ~You read my mind! Got another glass ready, I hope?~
@535  = ~I can spare a little time for you. No need to bribe me with a drink.~
@536  = ~Make it quick, Keto, we have much to attend to.~
@537  = ~Sorry, Keto, we don't have time for this right now. We'll talk later.~
@538  = ~This is an adventuring party, not a social club. Put up the wine, keep quiet, and watch what the hell you're doing.~
@539  = ~I never drink, Keto.~
@540  = ~Then what do you do for fun?~
@541  = ~No--don't answer that. Best that there are some secrets between companions.~
@542  = ~Here's your glass--don't worry, it's been cleaned--and just a bit of wine for you... there. Don't want to be responsible for dulling your senses, now do I?~
@543  = ~Heh, anyway, I just want to thank you for taking me along. I do appreciate it.~
@544  = ~Glad to have you along, Keto. I appreciate a good story as much as anyone else, and you have taste in wine, to boot!~
@545  = ~No need to thank me, Keto, I am happy to have your help. One can never have too many allies.~
@546  = ~Yes, well, you were nearby and willing to come with us. Besides, I'm not much for turning down a free source of alcohol.~
@547  = ~Do not get too comfortable, here. My party members come and go, and you are not any sort of exception.~
@548  = ~And you will remain welcome here, so long as you remember that we all have to work together. Do not forget that we need you at your best.~
@549  = ~Aye, but of course! Don't worry, it's been washed. Drink up! More where that came from, too. The reason why I called you aside, though, is so I can thank you. Really, I worried I'd be stuck doing the tavern circuit forever!~
@550  = ~Bah, a waste of your talent. I am much happier having you in my ranks. I wouldn't trade you for anything. Well, maybe I would, for a little more wine...?~
@551  = ~My companions come and go, so you are more than welcome until I kick you out.~
@552  = ~You are quite welcome. Has finding a group to travel with been so difficult?~
@553  = ~Heh, more a show of appreciation than a bribe, but aye, as you wish. I just want to thank you for bringing me along. This is an incredible break for me, you know.~
@554  = ~You are welcome here, and I understand you still have things to learn, but I do wish you would spend less time treating this like a social outing.~
@555  = ~Have you not had any luck finding people to travel with before?~
@556  = ~Oh, right. Didn't mean to distract you. I just wanted to say thank you, for letting me tag along and all.~
@557  = ~Don't mention it. Don't slack off. Now, let's go.~
@558  = ~Right, and the more you talk, the more I regret it. Just move.~
@559  = ~Oh, okay. We can talk later, then.~
@560  = ~I... I didn't realize I bothered you that much. I'm sorry. I'll do my best, though, I will!~
@561  = ~Aye, and there's more where that came from! It's good to have someone around willing to share a drink; it's amazing how many people give me the evil eye just for a little leisure.~
@562  = ~I don't want you to think I'm going to be lax, though. I know you invited me to help you, not to hang about and be a nuisance... and I'm going to do my best.~
@563  = ~At the risk of sounding utterly green, I admit this is the first party I've traveled with. And it's nice not to have to forage just for myself, make no mistake!~
@564  = ~Has it really been that hard to find someone to travel with?~
@565  = ~Well, I am glad to have you with us, Keto. You would definitely be hard to replace.~
@566  = ~It is very flattering that you decided to come along with us, then. I certainly hope we are not boring you.~
@567  = ~You have kept up rather well, so you have obviously been doing something right.~
@568  = ~Oh, that's the truth. Friends always make things easier. I'm just letting you know that I don't plan on disappointing you; I'm going to do my best.~
@569  = ~Though I'd rather not have to admit it, I'm still a little new at this. I haven't gotten a chance to travel with a party as of yet, not one worthy of the name.~
@570  = ~Well, I'm glad to have you with us, Keto. You would definitely be hard to replace.~
@571  = ~You have kept up with us rather well, so you have obviously been doing something right.~
@572  = ~Well, I do hope I can prove to be at least a little more valuable than *that*. I'll do my best, though, <CHARNAME>, and you're plenty welcome to join in a drink with me whenever you want.~
@573  = ~Anyway... sorry I bothered you.~
@574  = ~I didn't mean to sound presumptuous. I guess I should expect that you wouldn't want me around long. (sigh) I'm going to really try my best, <CHARNAME>, I promise.~
@575  = ~Just don't give up on me too quick, all right? I'm sure you were still learning once, too.~
@576  = ~Well, of course. I'm always at my best! I wouldn't ruin my grandest venture yet by being bleary and apt to forget.~
@577  = ~This is you at your best...? (sigh) I was giving you the benefit of the doubt.~
@578  = ~Okay, Keto. Just don't slack off. Now, let's go.~
@579  = ~That is a good thing. I am glad you are so enthusiastic. I would hate to be a boring disappointment.~
@580  = ~Heh, but of course. I'll sacrifice a bit of wine if it means I won't be left at the side of the road in favor of the next bard at liberty, aye?~
@581  = ~I don't want you to get to thinking that I'm just going to hang about and be a nuisance, though. Before, I've only been watching over my own skin, but I'll do my best to adapt to looking out for others. It's natural enough.~
@582  = ~It is flattering that you decided to come along with us, then. I certainly hope we aren't boring you?~
@583  = ~I'd hoped you considered me a bit more worthwhile than that, <CHARNAME>, but as you say. I'm sorry you see our partnership being such a short one.~
@584  = ~Well, been out on my own until now. It's nice being able to see the world without constantly worrying about being jumped when I'm looking the wrong way, aye?~
@585  = ~I'm doing my best, though, <CHARNAME>, and I'll continue to. I'll adjust, I'm pretty good at that.~
@586  = ~I believe you. And I agree, things are that much better when you have companions by your side. I know I would have hated to be out on my own.~
@587  = ~Well... someone to travel with that didn't immediately make me nervous, anyway. And there are too many batches of gloryhound adventurers running off to do something blatantly stupid.~
@588  = ~Heh. I am glad you don't consider my cause to be blatantly stupid, Keto.~
@589  = ~Obviously you have managed to get around a little, though. You are certainly keeping up with us just fine.~
@590  = ~Nice to know you have such a high opinion of my profession.~
@591  = ~Their loss. I am definitely happy to have with us, Keto. You would be hard to replace.~
@592  = ~You got it, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! I'll do what I can.~
@593  = ~Thanks for saying so. I like feeling useful for something other than passing out wine, heh. If I'd wanted that, I would've just become a barmaid!~
@594  = ~I just cannot see you doing that. But what IS it that you want to do, then?~
@595  = ~Barding suits you much better, I think. But don't mistake my praise for a license to let down your guard.~
@596  = ~You are quite useful just the way you are. in fact, you have been keeping up with us very well.~
@597  = ~That would be rather boring, I think. I certainly hope we aren't boring you.~
@598  = ~Boring me? Oh, Hells no! This is more exciting than running from kobolds and gibberlings, I assure you. It's wonderful to be out seeing the world without fearing being caught unaware, and having someone nearby to assist in my continued breathing is nice, too.~
@599  = ~I agree, things are that much better when you have companions by your side. I know I would have hated to be out on my own.~
@600  = ~Well, I am glad to have you with us, Keto. Keep up the good work.~
@601  = ~I did do quite a bit of traveling on my own, you know. From the Dales all the way into Amn. Been a long trip, but I made it out unscathed.~
@602  = ~Heh, though a lot of that was due to ingratiating myself into caravans with stories and wine. The rest of my success, I credit to my finely honed quick retreat.~
@603  = ~Seems like things are going to change for me, though. I know there's plenty left to be determined. Thank you for sitting to talk with me <CHARNAME>. I do think it's time to get moving, though, aye?~
@604  = ~Well... (ahem) You might be surprised. Give me a little more of a chance than that, <CHARNAME>, I won't let you down.~
@605  = ~Aye. I'm definitely glad to not be alone. Especially when I've got a seasoned group to travel with. Heh, it still amazes me. Don't mean to fawn, but this was on my list of things that probably wouldn't happen to me.~
@606  = ~Well, just don't slack off. Come on, we have things to do.~
@607  = ~Oh, of course not. Wasn't insinuating anything... well, wasn't trying to.~
@608  = ~(sigh) Suffice to say I'm glad to be here. After hearing so much about you at the Gate, and then coming down here and moping, only to actually be a part of your story... well, it's been quite the experience, to say the least.~
@609  = ~Seems like things are changing for me, though! Still plenty to be determined, of course, but thank you for talking with me <CHARNAME>. About time to be moving, though, don't you think?~
@610  = ~Oh, that's not what I mean. Well, not what I was trying to. (sigh) Believe me, I appreciate the Life, but I like *life*, too, and there's a difference between grand adventure and suicide. Suffice it to say I'm glad to be here. After hearing so much about you at the Gate, and then coming down here and moping, only to actually be a part of your story... well, it's been quite the experience, to say the least.~
@611  = ~Travel. See some places. Meet some people. Make a few friends. Stay alive. So far, so good, eh?~
@612  = ~Quite. You certainly suit your profession. Just don't slack off, and all will be well.~
@613  = ~It seems that way. You have certainly been keeping up with us well enough.~
@614  = ~It keeps things interesting. It sounds like you have had an intriguing life thus far. We aren't boring you, are we?~
@615  = ~How long have you been in the Order, Keldorn?~ [FWKETO97]
@616  = ~Each additional year makes it that much harder to remember the full count, Keto. As long as you have been alive, I am certain.~
@617  = ~That's... well, sheesh. Will you ever retire?~
@618  = ~So long as there are duties yet that the Order requires of me, I'll not stand down; I have many good years of service within me. Time will take its proper course.~
@619  = ~Aye, that it will; you have a family, though, don't you? Aren't you looking forward to spending time with them?~
@620  = ~Of course I would be pleased to have the time to give my wife and children the full attention they deserve.~
@621  = ~But so long as my service is required, my path takes me here; to the battlefield, to fight evil and injustice for those who cannot.~
@622  = ~All this talk about responsibility to the Order... but you avoid the responsibility you have to your own family.~
@623  = ~Child, do not speak lightly of things you cannot understand yet. Nor will you understand, until you acquire some sense of purpose rather than the idle wandering that seems to have comprised your life.~
@624  = ~Choices require sacrifices from us all.~
@625  = ~I apologize, Keldorn, but I envy you. If I had a home waiting for me, nothing in the world would stop me from going to it.~
@626  = ~I apologize, Keldorn, but you're to be envied. I know men fight and die for prizes far lesser than what awaits you at home.~
@627  = ~It'll be good when all this is over, don't you think, Imoen?~ [FWKETO72]
@628  = ~Yep. But I forgot to make big plans for the harvest dances before we set out.~
@629  = ~Better start without me. I don't think I'll be dancing any time soon.~
@630  = ~I didn't mean it like that. I mean, when all is right again.~
@631  = ~I'm foreseeing a lot of sitting in a bar with you folk, plenty of stories and wine...~
@632  = ~That would be nice. Hopefully when everything's past us we can remember more things to laugh about.~
@633  = ~I'd like to feel like doing that again someday.~
@634  = ~Nalia, I'm sorry about before. Really.~ [FWKETOC2]
@635  = ~Save it. You had no right to speak to me that way. And since, as you say, I have nothing to say that interests you, then so be it.~
@636  = ~I know, I know, I was... I was entirely out of line.~
@637  = ~I just... um... well, my temper can be a little quick sometimes.~
@638  = ~So I have noticed.~
@639  = ~And I don't like apologizing, either, but I am.~
@640  = ~Oh, come on! Friends? Please?~
@641  = ~I know you're only trying to help. I'm sure people DO appreciate it. I just...~
@642  = ~I could never stand charity myself, you see. Even if I haven't gotten terribly far... at least I'm the one that got me here. My choices and my will pulled me through.~
@643  = ~It shows.~
@644  = ~But, Keto, all people have the right to make their own choices and follow their free will.~
@645  = ~Well, of course.~
@646  = ~Then it is their choice to accept help if they want or need it. They deserve that option. Everyone does.~
@647  = ~I... suppose you have a point. I hadn't thought of it that way.~
@648  = ~Cheer up, Imoen! It's a bright, beautiful day in this big bright world of ours!~ [FWKETO73]
@649  = ~You're among friends, and we're on a path of adventure with great... things... upon the wind!~ [FWKETO74]
@650  = ~I'm on a path of adventure. You, Keto? You're drunk.~
@651  = ~Only on the nectar of glory!~
@652  = ~Well, aye, and some wine. No matter! Come on, now, sing with me: "Whoa, row the rattlin' bog, the bog down in the valley-o, whoa, row the rattlin' bog in the bog down in the valley-o.."~
@653  = ~Rattlin' bog? What? Hey, let go, and--ha! Oh, come on, you goon!~
@654  = ~"Well, in that bog there was a hole, a rare hole, a rattlin' hole, a hole in the bog, and the bog down in the valley-o." (Sing, Imoen! Nobody who matters is going to stare!)~
@655  = ~Whoa... row... the rattlin' bog in the bog down in the... valley.~
@656  = ~Oh, I can't do this.~
@657  = ~Nonsense! Come on, you can do better than that!~
@658  = ~No, really, Keto, I can't. I just... I don't feel much like singing right now. But you keep going, okay?~
@659  = ~Not much point now. I don't sing unless there's someone else to drown me out, heh.~
@660  = ~Whoa! Row the rattlin' bog, the bog down in the valleyyy... Oh! Whoa!~
@661  = ~That's got it!~
@662  = ~Row the rattlin' bog...~
@663  = ~...in the bog down in the valley-o!~
@664  = ~Yoshimo, I can't help but notice how often you declare your great fame, and yet... it seems no one has ever heard of you.~ [FWKETOD8]
@665  = ~That is highly subject to interpretation. Quite often I meet those with something to hide. They are distracted, and in their moment of unease forget even the great fame of the one facing them.~
@666  = ~Regardless, the mere suggestion of being renowned is an instant mark in my favor.~
@667  = ~Even though they've never heard of you?~
@668  = ~Of course. They do not dare run the risk of seeming uninformed before others.~
@669  = ~Not a bad strategy. Think maybe it could help me?~
@670  = ~Your zealous ambition will carry you just as far as any creative histories you might concoct.~
@671  = ~Thanks, Yoshimo, I think.~
@672  = ~Is everyone we meet in your debt somehow, Keto?~
@673  = ~I couldn't be *that* lucky. But I do travel plenty, and I'm known to be generous with favors.~ [FWKETOD9]
@674  = ~Amazing coincidence and good fortune, then, that we meet every grateful person you have helped right here in Amn.~
@675  = ~All right, they don't ALL owe me something.~
@676  = ~They surely think they do.~
@677  = ~Quite often I meet those with something to hide. Regardless, the mere suggestion of having been a help to them in the past is--~
@678  = ~--an instant mark in your favor. Most impressive.~
@679  = ~Aye, Yoshimo, I've learned the way of the scoundrel well by following your example.~
@680  = ~So not all of the debts I have heard of are true.~
@681  = ~Er. What?~
@682  = ~It was said around the Coronet that Salvanas had much to be grateful--~
@683  = ~--of COURSE not!~
@684  = ~See? Look what you've done! <CHARNAME> is getting impatient. Off with you.~
@685  = ~Hmm... mm... ahh... mm...~ [KETOWSTL] // FLUTEY
@686  = ~Ah, Keto, how lovely. A tune to calm the nerves?~
@687  = ~Seeing right through me as always.~
@688  = ~It does not take eyes as sharp as mine to see your discomfort.~
@689  = ~In a place like this? Sure I'm uncomfortable... Tymora knows there's all sorts of things watching from the shadows, waiting to strike.~
@690  = ~Suffice to say I'd much rather be in a tavern, even with an empty glass.~
@691  = ~Ah, yet are there not also all manner of ruffians in the city to be wary of? Whatever creatures you may fear in this place, the most terrifying predator is sometimes your own kind.~
@692  = ~Aye, but at least none of the humans I've met, no matter how depraved, had three eyes, excess appendages, and a penchant for using dead adventurers as rugs.~
@693  = ~There are strange things about, yes, but worry not! The three-eyed, many-armed beasts have to share the shadows with Yoshimo. And he will not let harm come to innocent bards.~
@694  = ~Or said bard's wine bottle?~
@695  = ~Yoshimo is but one man, Keto.~
@696  = ~Ah, Keto, it is your eyes that put such pressure on me. For some time I thought myself under consideration for devouring by some hidden beast.~
@697  = ~What have I done to deserve such attention?~
@698  = ~You make yourself worthy of attention just by being in sight, Yoshimo. You're a rather interesting fellow.~ [FWKETOE0]
@699  = ~Such flattery makes one wonder as to the cause.~
@700  = ~You can wonder. It's for very simple reasons, though. I'm sure you'll find out eventually.~
@701  = ~Ah, if ever there was an ominous phrase, that would be it. You possess an unnerving talent for foreshadowing, Miss Keto.~
@702  = ~Despite our past... misunderstandings, my wild redbreast, I trust you know this sparrow bears you no enmity?~
@703  = ~Unfortunate that I bear plenty for you, then, hmm?~ [FWKETO75]
@704  = ~Then more's the pity. As I remember it, our working relationship was once quite harmonious.~
@705  = ~Was it? By my memory, *you* were the one that insisted I was talentless and unworthy of a position anywhere in the playhouse.~
@706  = ~A light jest, sweet robin. 'Twas not in reference to the stage.~
@707  = ~Anomen, I'm sorry. Really sorry.~ [FWKETOE9]
@708  = ~For what?~
@709  = ~For... for all the heckling I've been giving you. I didn't know how hard this was for you.~
@710  = ~I need no sympathy from you. I will survive you and any other challenges, as I always have.~
@711  = ~No, let me finish. You're really trying to do something great with your life. And it was wrong of me to mock that..~
@712  = ~Aye, it is an example you would do well to follow. Admitting that you were wrong indicates hope for you yet.~
@713  = ~But I have little will to discuss any of this with you now. Weightier matters demand my attention.~
@714  = ~Of course, Anomen. Don't mind me.~
@715  = ~Thought we'd never rest our heels again! The only thing itching more than me killin' arm be me throat.~
@716  = ~Barman! Ale. Ale! One fer each hand, got it?~
@717  = ~Aye, and that'll be three for me. Saves time when one's empty, heh.~ [FWKETOF3]
@718  = ~Showin' me up, is that it, girlie? Got an itch to drink an old dwarf under the table?~
@719  = ~Hm? Oh, no. I was told long ago, "Never get into a drinking contest with a dwarf."~
@720  = ~Oh, so not only are ye a bloody rabbit awaiting slaughter on the battlefield, but yer a simpering child when it comes to the draught! Come on, word-spitter, prove ye have some guts afore I decide to check!~
@721  = ~Nine Hells, Korgan.~
@722  = ~Fine, fine, if it's that important to you.~
@723  = ~Har! Good. Drink yer first ale.~
@724  = ~Mmph...~
@725  = ~Ahhhhh...~
@726  = ~Ungh...~
@727  = ~Mmmmm...~
@728  = ~Hah! I count eleven drained tankards. Looks like less on yer side o' the bar, lass.~
@729  = ~Mmmugh... five...~
@730  = ~Oh? What a pity. Looks like the bite o' Cavern's Urge has ye a little green, there. Take it ye'll just be stumbling into the back and emptying yer guts?~
@731  = ~Har! Worthless girl! Can't hold yer liquor, yer courage, yer tongue--I'm amazed yer backbone's got enough grit to keep yerself standing with all the quavering ye do!~
@732  = ~Out o' my sight! Five ales--pathetic! I've had nieces do better afore their first beard came in.~
@733  = ~I'm never going to forget this. Urk... the Hells take you, Korgan.~
@734  = ~Not without a fight, and a bellyful of ale. Two things ye lack, heh!~
@735  = ~I don't trust you, Haer'Dalis.~ [FWKETO76]
@736  = ~And what has this sparrow done to offend you so? What a sad thing that a good-spirited challenge from one performer to another has destroyed the trust in yon sapphire orbs.~
@737  = ~You never had my trust to begin with. You've demon's ancestry, and you've done nothing to prove to me that it doesn't hold sway.~
@738  = ~How shallow of you, redbreast, to judge a man solely on distant forebearers. What deed, what trial of character must I pass to earn the removal of this damning blot?~
@739  = ~You forget I know you. All the time you spent trying to dig around in my mind, did you think I couldn't look into yours as well?~
@740  = ~I open both heart and mind to you, dear robin, for your perusal. I am as I am.~
@741  = ~You can open whatever you like, but I just don't trust you. I don't trust anybody who is as glad to meet you as he is to advocate the destruction of all you know.~
@742  = ~The Doomguard philosophy is difficult for Primes to understand, 'tis true. Yet you wound me in basing my entire worth on the path we all must follow, consciously or not.~
@743  = ~By that way of thinking, wouldn't it be best for <CHARNAME> to fail in <PRO_HISHER> quest? Isn't your place to assist that?~
@744  = ~Keto, if I considered it my place to merely destroy things at casual whim, I would, no doubt, have met Oblivion personally by now.~
@745  = ~While you seek only to wound me, my time for you is far more expansive, Keto.~
@746  = ~You show you have no real understanding of the Doomguard; this argument will lead to nowhere without my guidance.~
@747  = ~Aye, and "nowhere" is precisely where you'd be happiest, bringing the rest of us in tow.~
@748  = ~<CHARNAME>, I'm grateful you brought me along, now more than ever. Grand adventure, rescuing the downtrodden, and striking true against whatever villain comes against us. There will be songs written for us, to be certain, not to mention all the stories told by my own lips.~ [FWKETO77]
@749  = ~I will be there to hear them, Keto. It has been just as much a privilege to be in your company.~
@750  = ~No need for flattery. I just do what I think should be done.~
@751  = ~If we are still alive by then. There is just as good a chance that all our exploits will be rewarded only with death and ruin.~
@752  = ~Yes, there will be all manner of tales told about us, won't there? I can only hope they will all be so flattering as yours, Keto.~
@753  = ~Won't it be a grand time? Every tavern serving us the best, every minstrel in every corner lauding our deeds, envious as the Hells to be able to perform it even a measure as eloquently as you, my dear bard.~
@754  = ~I'm glad you are having a good time with us, Keto.~
@755  = ~Stop it. Your fawning is thoroughly annoying.~
@756  = ~Heh! Mutual admiration is a good thing. Thank you, <CHARNAME>, I'll not disappoint you.~
@757  = ~A fine little fantasy, that one! I look forward to being there, to be certain. And I do have faith that we will be someday!~
@758  = ~It's not flattery if it's true, aye? Don't get dismayed now. We're on the path of heroes, <CHARNAME>; you've seen to that.~
@759  = ~Aye, it doesn't get much better than this, even with the dungeon delving and monster slaying we can't seem to avoid. When I get nervous, all I have to do is remember what a grand tale this will make. And you, my friend, are the central player.~
@760  = ~And just look at how far that's taken us! Believe me, what you think is simply the best thing to do; why, it's what people build legends around!~
@761  = ~But I can see I'm making you uncomfortable, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry. Just trying to provide a little encouragement. It's my job, you know.~
@762  = ~(ahem) I'm deeply sorry for my offense, <CHARNAME>. I wish your words were as gallant as your actions.~
@763  = ~Oh, really, <CHARNAME>, have a little more heart than that! We've come so far already, and I have complete faith that we'll make it right on to the end.~
@764  = ~Don't let yourself be dismayed; you'll have friends with you the entire way.~
@765  = ~I'm a little uncomfortable with what you're doing, <CHARNAME>. You were a grand living legend in Baldur's Gate, and now you choose THIS path? I know you face some difficult choices as leader, but consider them more seriously, aye?~ [FWKETO78]
@766  = ~I was not meaning to worry you, Keto. It has just been a hard time for me. Things will get better. I will take care of everything.~
@767  = ~Would you stop griping, Keto? I do what I want. If you don't like it, you can leave.~
@768  = ~This is how I do things. Deal with it.~
@769  = ~Sorry, Keto. I will get things back on track soon, I promise.~
@770  = ~You do not seem to mind the power and prestige my methods bring you.~
@771  = ~Maybe I am sick of always being compared to what I was in Baldur's Gate, Keto. You joined the party on the basis of exaggeration and deception. I did what I did for my own purposes, as I do now, because it's MY life, damn you.~
@772  = ~Aye, I share enough in the spoils of your deeds but I don't approve, and I hope for change. There's a better path for us, <CHARNAME>, I'm certain of that.~
@773  = ~I understand. Things haven't been easy for any of us. I just don't want you to make matters worse, <CHARNAME>, that's all.~
@774  = ~I very well may. I don't owe you my help. Just seems a pity to watch you make all the praise given to you in Baldur's Gate into a lie.~
@775  = ~I don't *have* to "deal with it." I have my own conscience to contend with, <CHARNAME>. And, I assure you, you are doing it not a bit of good.~
@776  = ~I believe you. It's been a rough time for all of us; just no sense in making it worse.~
@777  = ~Well... I'm sorry you feel that way, <CHARNAME>, truly. And I'm sorry for myself that I was so glad to travel with someone that is nothing like I believed <PRO_HESHE> would be. I won't bother you again until it comes time for me to part ways with you. You can live your life; but I have to live mine, too.~
@778  = ~You are very fearful when you fight, Keto.~
@779  = ~Now, I can hardly expect much bravery from you, but you wince when you strike; surely you don't feel sympathy for the evil that falls at our feet?~
@780  = ~No, not so much, I just... I'm ill-suited for battle, Anomen, and I don't get the same excitement from it that you do.~ [FWKETO79]
@781  = ~Nay, not excitement, I but feel pride to know we further a valiant cause.~
@782  = ~It is a cause for concern when my comrades do not share that sentiment, and cannot feel righteous fury when faced with villainy.~
@783  = ~I won't flee and abandon the party to the fates, if that's what you're getting at.~
@784  = ~Your defensive nature shows itself even when no insult is offered. Your loyalty to <CHARNAME> is not under attack.~
@785  = ~So what ARE you attacking?~
@786  = ~Bah! Your blood boils only for a squabble over choice of words. I shall save my strength of arms for more meaningful clashes.~
@787  = ~Oh, finally. Thought I'd never see a bar again. Tender! One mug of--~ [FWKETO80]
@788  = ~Belay that order!~
@789  = ~You are here to aid <CHARNAME> by combating evil and excess. Your willful participation in those very same things reflects poorly on us all.~
@790  = ~Correction: YOU are fantatical about righteousness and all that, I am here to write a story and try not to die.~
@791  = ~Bah! Isn't there a trace of righteous honor in you anywhere? Or are you truly nothing but a spineless vagabond?~
@792  = ~Guilty as charged. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a beer awaiting my attention.~
@793  = ~This company I am forced to keep will drive me mad, surely.~
@794  = ~I'll say this for you, you get right to the heart of a problem. Settle it yourself.~ [FWKETO81]
@795  = ~I've always liked this story. Not that I think you need to learn from it, but it's a favorite of mine.~ [FWKETO82]
@796  = ~I really don't have time for this at the moment, Keto.~
@797  = ~Only if it is not too long. I have more problems to solve, after all.~
@798  = ~Sure, Keto. I love a good story, and I like hearing them from you.~
@799  = ~Get away from me, girl, and save your stories for the drunkards who pay you.~
@800  = ~Not a problem, <CHARNAME>.~
@801  = ~I'll, ahem, try to give you the short version.~
@802  = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>. If you're trying to get out of a tip, though, this one's on the house anyway.~
@803  = ~Hmph. Time's wasted on you anyway.~
@804  = ~In one of Suzail's more posh districts, law and order was maintained by a man named Inspector Brace. Brace had built his reputation as a meticulous man--kind who knew where every pike and pair of boots in his barracks was at all times.~
@805  = ~So when a spy named Corric pilfered a document from a Sembian agent--you know, the kind that says who's paying who to keep quiet about what, the kind that would have embarrassed both Cormyr and Sembia--well, it seemed logical that Brace would be the man to crack the case.~
@806  = ~And the job was mostly done for him. Corric had botched the theft, as he was followed to the house he was using as a base of operations. The Cormyrian authorities were positive he had stashed the letter in the house. All Brace had to do was find it.~
@807  = ~Brace set about the job with all diligence and enthusiasm. He inspected every crack and crevice in the house himself. Only reluctantly did he admit he would need help, at which point a team of a dozen of his finest soldiers and agents took apart every piece of furniture, sliced open every rug, even took apart the fireplace brick by brick looking for the letter. They all failed.~
@808  = ~Brace wasn't about to give up, however. He called in the local Dawnmaster, who summoned a powerful spirit and asked it to reveal where the letter was hidden, but the servant could not say. Two difference warlocks worked their magics to try to find evidence of a planar gate, a rift in space, a stitch in time, but they, too, went away shaking their heads.~
@809  = ~Brace even went so far as to cut a very dubious deal with the local Shadowmaster to comb the premises for secret hiding places, but the master thief could find nothing.~
@810  = ~Brace spent a long, long time in that house as the days stretched to weeks, often sitting up all night in the center of the sitting room. One night his wife reached her breaking point, and sent their son to fetch his father.~
@811  = ~The boy dashed through the streets and came to the house, abandoned by the day's searchers hours earlier. He saw his father slumped across the desk, snoring softly. A few candles were still lit and the boy's curiosity got the better of him. Atop the mantle he spied a letter rack and, even though his father had told him it was very wrong to touch other people's property, he allowed himself to pluck the frontmost envelope from the rack and give it a look. He was so very proud of his reading, after all.~
@812  = ~Don't tell me. The runt found it.~
@813  = ~So, how does it end, Keto?~
@814  = ~Ooooh! Wait! Wait! I know! It was there all the time!~
@815  = ~Zzzzzzz...~
@816  = ~I'm getting there, <CHARNAME>.~
@817  = ~Yep. Indeed he did. Sitting there in plain view, all the time.~
@818  = ~Ah, you've been paying attention, <CHARNAME>!~
@819  = ~The boy glanced at letter in the envelope and, proud of his reading as he was, he didn't know how to pronounce words like "concubine" and "extortion", let alone what they meant, so completely forgetting that his father might be angry, he woke him up to ask.~
@820  = ~Needless to say, Brace was at once furious and delighted. Brace wasn't too proud a man to admit that he had made a terrible, foolish mistake, and even offered his resignation, but he was rewarded for being in the right place at the right time after all.~
@821  = ~It's good to be good, <CHARNAME>, and it's good to be clever, but if you can't be clever or good, you can always be lucky!~
@822  = ~<CHARNAME>, I know it's a bit of a strange question, but I wonder... what does your name mean?~ [FWKETOC6]
@823  = ~What? Oh, Keto, sorry, but I'm a little too busy for chatter right now.~
@824  = ~I've heard that my name means "strength," which is suitable enough, I think.~
@825  = ~<CHARNAME>? It refers to "dragon" or "draconic."~
@826  = ~It means "one who is wise."~
@827  = ~"Lion" or "lionhearted" is the interpretation, I believe.~
@828  = ~I think it means "conqueror."~
@829  = ~"Noble ruler." Impressive, isn't it?~
@830  = ~I think it just means "nightfall."~
@831  = ~It means "rising storm." I like it.~
@832  = ~<CHARNAME> means "peace," though heaven knows I don't get much of it.~
@833  = ~Nothing exciting, I'm afraid. It just refers to "a stony field."~
@834  = ~"Love," actually. Don't laugh.~
@835  = ~"Wolf." What about it?~
@836  = ~Not exactly uplifting, I know, but <CHARNAME> means "sorrow."~
@837  = ~"A bright flame."~
@838  = ~It means "beloved" as I recall.~
@839  = ~"Splendor," I think.~
@840  = ~My name means "constant protector."~
@841  = ~I'm actually not at all sure what my name means.~
@842  = ~I made up my name for myself. It means what it says.~
@843  = ~I really don't care, Keto.~
@844  = ~I know what it means, but the words are not coming to me.~
@845  = ~Yoshimo, tell me a little of yourself. It's for the story I'm writing about our travels.~ [FWKETOE2]
@846  = ~Why, I would scarcely know where to begin.~
@847  = ~Somehow, I doubt that.~
@848  = ~I think you're playing games with me. For all you talk about the Great Yoshimo, you avoid actually *saying* anything about yourself. Why?~
@849  = ~I simply find others more interesting, Keto. You, for instance.~
@850  = ~I, ah... what?~
@851  = ~Yes. What are the untold mysteries of Keto? Even by the standards of professional wanderers, you shy from inquiries of home. You carry an aura of mystery beyond your tender years--~
@852  = ~That's your imagination. I'm... nothing, Yoshimo.~
@853  = ~Your confidence has fled so suddenly over a meaningless word, one I am surprised to hear from one so eloquent. No one is nothing.~
@854  = ~I'm fine, Yoshimo, really. Just walk beside me, if... if it isn't too much to ask.~
@855  = ~If that is your wish, I am glad to accompany you.~
@856  = ~You're a long way from home, aren't you, Yoshimo?~ [FWKETOE3]
@857  = ~On the contrary. At any moment, I am home. When I leave this place, it will no longer be home.~
@858  = ~Still, I am assured that I will rest each evening in my own bed.~
@859  = ~An easy philosophy. But, come on, isn't there someplace you have to return to someday?~
@860  = ~Ah, you mean a place of origin? It is not someplace I think I will see again anytime soon.~
@861  = ~Why do you think that?~
@862  = ~We have <CHARNAME>'s quest to consider, of course. And of course, there are many things in Amn for one of my abilities to do, none that I would wish to abandon too quickly.~
@863  = ~So there is no weeping lover awaiting your return, clutching a stack of love poems and dried flowers?~
@864  = ~It pains me to disappoint your romantic imagination, but any maiden pining for my return has doubtless moved on by now.~
@865  = ~And yourself, Keto? What sturdy lad awaits you, anticipating your return with warm hearth and wine?~
@866  = ~Hmm? Oh, uh, well, nobody. I'm a loner, heh.~
@867  = ~Where I lay my beer is home... or somesuch thing like that.~
@868  = ~Ah, a kindred soul in that easy philosophy. Then tonight, we both rest easily in our own beds, yes?~
@869  = ~Yes. Tonight, we do...~
@870  = ~My good robin, you've scarcely said a word to me since our reunion. Your brilliant blue eyes tremble when they look upon me, but I cannot as yet discern their meaning.~
@871  = ~Stuff it, Haer'Dalis.~ [FWKETO83]
@872  = ~Like the cinders of a bonfire--softly burning, but still blistering. What inspires such anger? I must know.~
@873  = ~Keep wondering.~
@874  = ~I've not seen you so inhospitable before. It hardly suits your sensitive nature.~
@875  = ~You've also not seen me anywhere close to angry yet. Back off, "sparrow," lest I start plucking.~
@876  = ~'Tis clear that I am well advised to mark the lonely march of the moon through the night sky, and bide for a more hospitable phase.~
@877  = ~Valygar, how about a joke to lighten the spirits, aye?~ [FWKETO84]
@878  = ~If you must, Keto.~
@879  = ~(ahem) All right--stop me if you've heard this one. A mighty warrior walks into a bar and says "Ow!"~ [FWKETO85]
@880  = ~...~
@881  = ~Uh. Get it?~
@882  = ~...That was the joke?~
@883  = ~Well, it was supposed to be. Hey, I never claimed it was amusing.~
@884  = ~No, you didn't.~
@885  = ~Right, right.~
@886  = ~Since that bit of humor didn't go over so well, let me try another. How many wizards does it take to light a candle?~
@887  = ~More than I care to think about. Excuse me.~
@888  = ~The sun seems to shine its brightest as it is dying in the sky.~
@889  = ~You finally say something to me, and it's THAT cheerful thought?~ [FWKETO86]
@890  = ~Sorry to disappoint you.~
@891  = ~Come on! You've good health, good company, and a chance at being the kind of hero most people can only dream about.~
@892  = ~That has to be worth something.~
@893  = ~There are heavier concerns.~
@894  = ~You could lighten your load. If you don't mind speaking, Valygar, I'll gladly listen.~
@895  = ~My family's obsession with magic and power has poisoned the line, and I will ensure it dies with me. I am sure you can see how that could bother me.~
@896  = ~I never claimed that I couldn't. It's just... sometimes the burden we place on ourselves is unnecessary.~
@897  = ~The curse didn't take hold on you, did it? Aren't you proof that it's the will, not the blood, that shapes someone?~
@898  = ~I know you mean well, but you have not lived with this cloud over your head, or felt the responsibility that I do for the crimes and sickness of my ancestors. I do not expect you to understand.~
@899  = ~You look a little peaked, Edwina--do you feel all right?~ [FWKETO87]
@900  = ~Yes, I feel fine. Everything is just fine! Now leave me be.~
@901  = ~Obviously, you aren't fine.~
@902  = ~*Somebody's* moody.~
@903  = ~Wait... I think I know what it is.~
@904  = ~What? What could you possibly know? Talentless buffoon.~
@905  = ~Calm down. Try eating something sweet, and be sure to get plenty of rest when we stop. You'll be feeling better in a few days.~
@906  = ~I don't need nor desire your remedies. I can take care of myself. Nothing has changed, so cease your babbling! (Something sweet? Why does that sound so appealing?)~
@907  = ~Ach, just when I thought *I* was a stalwart drinker...~ [FWKETO88]
@908  = ~Girlie, how can ye call that sorry wine-sippin' ye do "drinking"? A sniff o' real ale would have ye down fer days, a fitting way to end yer prattle.~
@909  = ~Ahem. That "real ale" you prefer can also strip the skin right off a kobold.~
@910  = ~Mayhaps ye should tote it to use on a few of the buggers, then. Could have saved ye running like a scalded little girl from the Firewine, aye?~
@911  = ~A damn sight more effective than the flailing ye do in combat. Flailing to get away, that is.~
@912  = ~I... ah.~
@913  = ~I'll just be with my wine. Over here.~
@914  = ~Just how I'd have it.~
@915  = ~(Hmm. Could it be...? No, no, that's not right, it must've been before--unless, of course, this was written afterwards. Damnable historians...)~
@916  = ~Er, what are you studying there, Edwin? Anything I could help with?~ [FWKETO89]
@917  = ~You, Keto? No, I need nothing from you; return to your inept humming.~
@918  = ~Don't be difficult. It's possible that I know something you don't. Let me see...~
@919  = ~(No, the fop will NOT be the one to decipher this!) Bah! Let go, idiot woman, before it tears!~
@920  = ~Why are you being so weird about it? Would you just let me look?~
@921  = ~Fine, fine! Here! But I didn't need you. Clearly that is a recounting of the reign of King Niwed X--~
@922  = ~...just without any mention of a king, his reign, or a shred of history at all...~
@923  = ~You're reading it wrong, you fool! I'll take that back, now.~
@924  = ~Looked like a halfling cooking primer, from the five seconds I had it--~
@925  = ~Which shows you a fool all the more. (If the bard is right, I will FRY that moronic peddler. Never trust gnomish merchandise!)~
@926  = ~Heh, as you say.~
@927  = ~One small suggestion; I'd replace the garlic with pepper on the salmon recipe, or you'll have dragon breath all day.~
@928  = ~BAH! Move ON, infuriating one!~
@929  = ~As the deer falls to the wolf's jaws, the sun climbs in the sky to illuminate the day once again.~
@930  = ~And so, too, as the leaves of an autumn tree fall into the noisy current of a babbling brook, as do a collection of weary companions hurl stones at the incoherent rambling stemming from a noise that, like the woodpecker, grates on the skull like a rock to...~ [FWKETO90]
@931  = ~...oh, Hells, I confused myself.~ [FWKETO91]
@932  = ~Are you indicating I talk too much, Keto?~
@933  = ~Too much? No, not really. I just don't know what you're trying to say most of the time.~
@934  = ~Ah, Keto, that is because you do not listen for what is not spoken plainly; often the simplest statement has an underyling meaning that will tell you what is truly meant.~
@935  = ~As a teller of tales, you should appreciate that better than most.~
@936  = ~But that's business, Cernd. This is pleasure. Wouldn't it be easier to mean what you say and say what you mean?~
@937  = ~It might, but that--~
@938  = ~--would put the "wise" out of work?~
@939  = ~Like the great oak watching a sapling spring from the earth, unmindful of the grating of the young branches against its bark, so I endure you, Keto.~
@940  = ~You know, you think the world's crowded when you live in the cities, but after you travel a little and stick to the roads and places less traveled, you realize how much is left over.~ [FWKETO92]
@941  = ~As ants cling to their colonies, bees to the hive, and horses to the plains, so, too, do people congregate among their own.~
@942  = ~You are right when you say much of the land yet belongs to nature, but populations cluster in new territory every day. It remains a concern, though you may see it as a distant one.~
@943  = ~...Right. Can we keep walking, now?~
@944  = ~Cernd? Cernd? Still with us?~ [FWKETO93]
@945  = ~Hmm? Of course, Keto. What do you need?~
@946  = ~Off in your own little world there?~
@947  = ~You may see me as a majestic tree standing silent guard--~
@948  = ~Oh, no...~
@949  = ~--but I am the cat that prowls just beyond its canopy. I am a part of this world, Keto. I feel its embrace, and there are no secrets between us. Walking with nature, beneath the shelter she offers, rather than struggling against it, affords peace and protection.~
@950  = ~You have learned to pass through nature without causing grievous offense, but you still make a great deal of noise.~
@951  = ~I've been around plenty of trees in my travels, aye. I don't think I'm really struggling against the forest, though.~
@952  = ~You ignore what you are not trained to see. And so you make your way all the more difficult.~
@953  = ~How am I supposed to react to something I can't see?~
@954  = ~Learn something about the world around you. Listen to the trees, and learn their stories. Play your music to the heather as you would to the tavern patron.~
@955  = ~The potential is within you. I have seen with my own eyes the way you embrace new experiences the way moss takes to rock, fish take to water--~
@956  = ~Right, right, I might look into it--so long as nobody's watching me do it.~
@957  = ~I think today will be a good day. Just look at the sky! Ever seen such a bright shade of blue, Jan?~ [FWKETO94]
@958  = ~Oh, several times. Most recently it was in Ma Jansen's face. You see, cousin Josie brought home the surliest dwarf you could possibly imagine. No, surlier than that. He had a mouth like a tarpit and smelled twice as bad. Well, when he spit up Ma's prized turnip custard, her face turned a few shades of burnt umber before turning to a very similar shade of blue as the one hanging over us this fine day.~
@959  = ~Oh. Sounds terrible. What did Ma Jansen say about all this?~
@960  = ~Well, naturally, we had to wake her back up--can't expect a gnome's face to turn such a shade without a fainting spell or three. The moment she woke up, she said "Where are my spectacles?" which had us all in stitches since Ma's been blind for years.~
@961  = ~Then she turned and looked for Josie and Gullswallow--that was his name--but they'd already taken off to pick some turnips. At least, that's what Josie said, but if you ask me, I think they were playing "Hide the Turnip" in the barn, if you get my drift.~
@962  = ~I don't think I should even ask.~
@963  = ~Oh, it's not what you think. No gnome can turn down a good game of "Hide the Turnip." Somebody digs a hole and hides a turnip. If you find it, it's yours. If you don't, another turnip grows in its place.~
@964  = ~And that wasn't the only time I saw this shade of blue.~
@965  = ~And where was that? The bottom of your aunt's moldy turnip jar?~
@966  = ~It's so hard to remember. You see, during the last wave of cutbacks in turnip research and development, I was working on the blueprints for the perfect turnip peeler at the old Jansen compound, and what plans they were! The sheet covered up the porch, threshold, part of the window, and the first three steps, but it was my crowning achievement, for I'd finally figured out how to make it peel a turnip.~
@967  = ~Anyway, I was just beginning to work out the quantity of pig iron and feathers we would be needing to put one in every home in Amn--~
@968  = ~I thought you couldn't remember?~
@969  = ~Remember what?~
@970  = ~The last time--the OTHER last time--you saw the shade of blue in the sky.~
@971  = ~I think.~
@972  = ~I never look up into the sky, Keto. Wouldn't want to go blind like poor Ma.~
@973  = ~Now, where was I? So about midway through that lengthy calculation, the quill broke. I didn't want to forget to carry the 37, so I sprang up to dash into the house and fetch another one from under Uncle Scratchy's bed. But I slipped on the turnip peeler plans and ended up flat on my back. Got a very good view of the sky that way, and, yes, it was this very blue.~
@974  = ~I hate this color. When I fell, I smudged the plans for the turnip peeler to ruin and gave myself a terrible headache. I'll thank you to never mention the sky to me again, Keto. You should be ashamed of yourself, picking at a gnome's old wounds like that.~
@975  = ~I'm... sorry?~
@976  = ~We've seen a lot of death, and we've certainly earned our spoils. Gets me to thinking about what happens after death, though, especially for those left behind.~ [FWKETO98]
@977  = ~I feel a story coming on... does it have to be now, Keto? I am in the middle of a very important thought.~
@978  = ~Hah. When I am finished, there isn't anyone left behind.~
@979  = ~It sounds to me like you need to talk about it.~
@980  = ~Be silent, I haven't the time for this.~
@981  = ~We all earn our rewards, do we not?~
@982  = ~Surely you do not fear death, Keto. You play the craven, but I have seen you fight.~
@983  = ~Hmph. You don't even know what it was going to be. Maybe I'll give you another chance later.~
@984  = ~I... suppose you have a point. But maybe that makes it all the more important to hear what I have to say.~
@985  = ~Oh, I fear it all right. That I've made it this far with you... well, I don't want to run out on anyone, and there just isn't a better story going in the Realms, if you don't mind me saying so.~
@986  = ~But I'm not thinking about fear. I'm thinking about a more... human aspect of life and death.~
@987  = ~Yes. Yes we do. But sometimes it's not so much what we take as what we leave behind that matters.~
@988  = ~Oh, I know! You always are. That's why it's important to take the time to hear a story!~
@989  = ~There's an old tale about the raider tribes from the Moonshaes... must be, oh, gods, at least a millennium ago.~
@990  = ~One of the fiercest raider lords was a man named Hacta. His holdings weren't the biggest or his raiding forces the largest, but they sailed harder and fought longer and generally terrified everyone in the isles and even on what we know now as the Sword Coast, where he would "visit" every couple of years just to keep the simple folk that settled there huddled and afraid.~
@991  = ~When Hacta came back from his journeys, his wife Nura was always waiting for him. Nura's husband was a professional brute and you don't just leave that at the door when you come home, but it's said she loved him all the same.~
@992  = ~Of course, Hacta went on one raid too many and came home dead. In those tribes, tradition was that the dead's property was divided up to his next of kin and tribesmen through a pecking order.~
@993  = ~Hacta was a rich man, so it took a couple of days to get all of his belongings together in his longhall. Anything that wouldn't fit, like his ships and his claims on nearby territory, was recorded on chits by the young scribes.~
@994  = ~Tradition said that the widow got the first choice, and she could take whatever she wished. And oh, how the people speculated. Would she take the longhall and run it herself, a fine way to catch a strong new husband from the travelers that passed through its doors?~
@995  = ~But Nura was not considered a weak woman, so might she choose his crown, and try to regroup his bondsmen and rule herself? Would she take his finest ship and answer the call of her raider blood?~
@996  = ~The barrels and crates were brought in, the treasures piled high on the longhall tables, and Hacta himself laid in state to oversee the proceedings.~
@997  = ~When the time came, all eyes were on Nura, but she deferred her choice to Hacta's father, a cripple who yet lived. Then she passed on her turn to their sons, the eldest already a blooded raider.~
@998  = ~It didn't stop there. She passed her turn to her husband's trusted aides, his bondsmen, minor relatives, even his servants.~
@999  = ~This went on for hours until finally, after the chambermaid had sheepishly made her third pick by laying claim to Nura's own bed, that the village elders cried out in anguish and begged her to take something--anything!~
@1000 = ~Nura rose from her seat, went to her husband's still body, and laid her hand on his chest. She looked down at him and smiled--not the twisted grin of a grieving widow, but a calm, happy, pleasant thing. The assembly was breathless, waiting for something else to happen. But nothing did.~
@1001 = ~She looked up at them, still smiling. "There. I have taken all my Hacta ever really owed me," she said. And without another word, she marched out of the longhall and out of sight, smiling all the while.~
@1002 = ~What an unimaginative bore.~
@1003 = ~That's truly beautiful, Keto. If only we could all be that noble.~
@1004 = ~I suppose there is some small value in the parables of simple folk.~
@1005 = ~If you think I am too greedy, you could simply say so.~
@1006 = ~Life's not like that, Keto. Not for me. They won't take and take and take from me anymore!~
@1007 = ~Me, or her?~
@1008 = ~Wait, don't answer that. Eh, never mind, then. Was only a tale.~
@1009 = ~Aye, if only. Wasn't meant to tell you how to live, <CHARNAME>. Just a thought about how some people deal with loss. Inspires me, anyway.~
@1010 = ~More than you'd think, <CHARNAME>. Oh, I'm not going to pretend that everything was better in the days of old, but after all this time at least, the tales have a way of distilling their lives and showing us what's really important.~
@1011 = ~That's why I tell them, and that's why people listen, even today, even if they've heard it a dozen times before.~
@1012 = ~No, not at all! We've got our own problems to deal with, certainly. Don't think I'm getting soft on our foes, heh.~
@1013 = ~<CHARNAME>! Peace! Relax! Nobody's out to get you--nobody here, at any rate!~
@1014 = ~Of course I don't mean you should just stand by and let anyone take from you. Just thought it would be interesting to hear how some people deal with loss.~
@1015 = ~I'll--I'll rethink telling this one, I suppose.~
@1016 = ~Jan, you remind me of someone I had a brief acquaintance with a year or so ago.~ [FWKETO96]
@1017 = ~Oh? You know, now that I think of it, you remind me of someone, too. You see--~
@1018 = ~It was while I was travelling through Trademeet on my way to Athkatla, when I happened to begin corresponding with a local book merchant--~
@1019 = ~--way back when I was a wee gnome, still hitting the top of my head upon the underside of the table (by accident, anyway) we all happened to go out to the turnip farm to help Uncle Scratchy with the harvest--~
@1020 = ~--his name was Mios. A soft-spoken fellow, so obviously HE'S not who I'm reminded of, with a wife who tormented him. He often let me read his stock of books, and in return I brought him food since his wife had stopped cooking for him--~
@1021 = ~--It was a bumpy ride on the turnip wagon, let me tell you. My rump was one big bruise by time we arrived. I still have those bruises today, although they're on my knees now. As we were coming around the final bend, we saw a ragged minstrel fleeing from a pack of angry chickens. Apparently he was hungry and tried to steal a leg, but didn't have the foresight to kill one of the chickens beforehand. Anyway, my dear-hearted mother felt sorry for him and let him ride with us in the wagon. He was very grateful, but in addition to knowing nothing about chickens or turnips, we discovered he was a--~
@1022 = ~--but Mios had a son, about four years old, who had a fondness for me and followed me around the square; I swear the child didn't need to breathe, he was a completely--~
@1023 = ~--incessant chatterer. We were turnip-catapult distance from the farm, and yet there the whole lot of us were nearly driven boggy by very uninteresting stories that kept circling around the old run-of-the-mill epics you can hear for a copper a dozen in any tavern. He had no concern whether he--~
@1024 = ~--and all the time he was cutting people off in the middle of sentences, and--~
@1025 = ~--changed the subject, completely ignoring us when we tried to tell our own humble little tales. Really, I--~
@1026 = ~--can't say that he meant any harm. I mean, really, he was just a child. I was still relieved when I left--~
@1027 = ~At Uncle Scratchy's door, we got rid of him and sent him on his way, though he was chased down by the chicken pack pretty quick. I think he might've gotten a wing or two, so all those pecks weren't a complete loss.~
@1028 = ~I'm pretty sure his mother must have gagged him by now.~
@1029 = ~I hope you aren't terribly offended?~
@1030 = ~Offended? No, no, I couldn't agree more.~ ~Aunt Jemma always said that listening to the honest truth about yourself is about as noble as noble gets. In fact, Aunt Jemma herself--~
@1031 = ~You know, I'm glad all of that is out of the way; I hope we understand each other better now, Jan, since I think we--~
@1032 = ~--listens to others very proficiently...~
@1033 = ~Tell me something, young woman. I have been party to more than one battle where not a scout or chronicler survived the day, yet bards in every alehouse along the march home greeted the column with a tale of every man who fought.~
@1034 = ~How do such stories spread like wildfire?~
@1035 = ~Maybe from the soldiers that decided a career change was in order after barely surviving? They never make very good bards, though, those. Run off and become brewers or candlestick makers after the first hostile audience.~ [FWKETO99]
@1036 = ~So entertainers are well satisfied to build and spread their histories on the word of faithless oathbreakers? I would have hoped for more devotion to the truth of men who fought and died, not the recollections of fleeing cowards.~
@1037 = ~Keldorn, we don't ask where the stories come from, or how; if they have a tale to share, we listen. It's part of what it is to be a bard. Ours is the way of the storyteller, not the historian.~
@1038 = ~I am not a man for bold stories and songs of valor, Keto. But if they must be told, those men who stayed to fight and die deserve the truth. Not the glorified recollection of one whose only memory is his own panic.~
@1039 = ~Ah, but people want to hear the tales, Keldorn. They don't care if it's the truth, so long as it stirs the soul.~
@1040 = ~An unfortunate state of affairs, if it is tales from the low and the faithless which appeal most.~
@1041 = ~(sigh) I don't know if that's really how it goes. Perhaps the stories come from a poor soldier, a "coward" if you want, running away to save himself and telling the story of the battle for a pint at the nearest inn.~
@1042 = ~No one knows. That's the point. Everything told is taken with the same grain of salt... by most people, anyway. I suppose that's why you went the way of a knight rather than that of an entertainer, hmm?~
@1043 = ~I would not pretend to know any life better than my own, bard. But the truth of men who die for a cause is not currency to be counterfeited for an audience. That is a lesson you may learn, with experience.~
@1044 = ~Artists are SO misunderstood.~
@1045 = ~You've been very preoccupied with your arm, Keto. What ails you?~
@1046 = ~It hurts.~ [FWKETOA0]
@1047 = ~Yes, that much is apparent. There is no need for such evasion when one offers you aid.~
@1048 = ~I'd elaborate if I could, really. I'm not sure what's wrong with it. It just aches occasionally.~
@1049 = ~Quite normal when damage has been done to the bone; many soldiers complain of an old broken bone aching in the winter or a rainy spell.~
@1050 = ~Why can't you discern where you recieved such a wound, though? Or were you too far into your own excesses to remember?~
@1051 = ~I've never blacked out from drink, Keldorn. I can remember my life perfectly well, until--~
@1052 = ~(cough) I fell down a gorge, once, a number of years ago. I suffered several injuries, and while I don't recall breaking my arm, it's possible I damaged it.~
@1053 = ~There were quite a few other things I was paying attention to at the time, though.~
@1054 = ~Well, we have discovered the source of your ache, at least. How did you manage to fall into a gorge?~
@1055 = ~(sigh) With all due respect Keldorn--mind your own business.~
@1056 = ~No doubt something foolish indeed, then. And unusual that you wish to create mystery around a fall you remember but injuries you do not.~
@1057 = ~I mean it, Keldorn. I mean neither you, nor <CHARNAME>, nor any member of this party any harm. I came here to help, and so I shall.~
@1058 = ~Please just let it be at that.~
@1059 = ~I find your words troubling, Keto.~
@1060 = ~Take a look around, Val! People of every walk of life traveling to their destinations, buildings in wood and stone rising above the ground, music and conversation wafting out from the bars, and secure shelter away from the elements.~ [FWKETOA1]
@1061 = ~Nothing can match it! It's so full of life, don't you think?~ [FWKETOA2]
@1062 = ~Yes. Pestilence, hunger, murder, greed and pollution... few places can boast the low forms of life that permeate a city.~
@1063 = ~And don't call me Val.~
@1064 = ~Oh, come on. What's so wonderful about the forest? Rabbits, deer, and trees all day would get boring after a while, without anyone around.~
@1065 = ~The rabbits, deer, and trees have quieter opinions regarding what I choose to do with my time.~
@1066 = ~Deer and rabbits talk?~
@1067 = ~Oh. Right. Point taken.~
@1068 = ~Hmm... hey, Cernd, can I eat these berries?~ [FWKETOA3]
@1069 = ~Absolutely. If you appreciate the finer points of chewing upon your own blood.~
@1070 = ~Ach. Thanks for the warning. Seems pretty cruel to me, trying to kill a poor defenseless girl looking for a snack.~
@1071 = ~The loveliest flower in the forest might have poison thorns and the plumpest berries a caustic juice, but that is the way of defenses in the wild.~
@1072 = ~Nature bears you no malice, Keto.~
@1073 = ~Bears me no berries, either.~
@1074 = ~What's this? Why are you throwing things at me, girl?~
@1075 = ~A pecan for your thoughts. Something's on your mind.~ [FWKETOA4]
@1076 = ~The expression is "a copper for your thoughts."~
@1077 = ~So I'm poor. Eat the nut and talk to me.~
@1078 = ~You have strange ways, child, and I've no need to share my mind with you. The load is bearable.~
@1079 = ~If you insist... Can I have the pecan back?~
@1080 = ~No. You should not throw away what you are not prepared to lose.~
@1081 = ~Everything's so quiet and simple out here.~ [FWKETOA5]
@1082 = ~That it is. While I appreciate the peace that being among nature allows, you find the lack of voices discomforting, no?~
@1083 = ~Not quite. I'm just not used to being able to hear myself think, heh.~
@1084 = ~Then what is it you are hearing that gives you such an odd expression?~
@1085 = ~Nothing important. Memories, mostly.~
@1086 = ~Memories are important, Keto. To forget where you have been, those you have known, and... lost, that is a terrible thing.~
@1087 = ~That it is, Jaheira. For once, we're in total agreement.~
@1088 = ~That's an interesting look you're giving me, Imoen.~ [FWKETOA6]
@1089 = ~I'm trying to figure out how you do it, because I can't remember.~
@1090 = ~What's that, Imoen?~
@1091 = ~No matter where we are, or what's happening, you stay in good spirits.~
@1092 = ~We can't all be gloomy, even when things are bad. Gotta be able to laugh still.~
@1093 = ~Even when you're dying inside?~
@1094 = ~That's an excellent way to kill any attempts at cheer.~
@1095 = ~I'm sorry. I'm trying not to be depressed. But it's... harder, now.~
@1096 = ~I know.~
@1097 = ~How would you?~
@1098 = ~You still remember who you are, don't you, even if you can't feel it quite as strongly?~
@1099 = ~That's true. I mean, I feel like I can, but--~
@1100 = ~Cling to that, Imoen.~
@1101 = ~I don't understand.~
@1102 = ~You don't need to, just trust me. What is remembered isn't really gone. We'll get your soul back.~
@1103 = ~I'll hang on to whatever I can...~
@1104 = ~Ooof!~ [FWKETOA7]
@1105 = ~Minsc, watch where you step. You're a lot bigger than I am!~ [FWKETOA8]
@1106 = ~Sorry, little bard. Boo was uncomfortable, so I had to move him to the other pouch.~
@1107 = ~That up-close introduction to your armor hurt, you know!~
@1108 = ~Hey, how did you know Boo was uncomfortable, anyway?~
@1109 = ~Boo always tells me when his pouch gets too smelly. As for stomping nice bards, I will do what I do for Boo; pat your head and hope you forgive me.~
@1110 = ~Oh. Right. Of course.~
@1111 = ~Ow! Minsc... stop... ow! Stop... patting my... head... ow... ow...ow!~
@1112 = ~Oops. Boo says you are not thick-headed, and I should not pat so hard.~
@1113 = ~No, Minsc, you just have a strong arm. But, my thanks to, uh, Boo, for the fine praise.~
@1114 = ~Ah. Er.~ [FWKETOA9]
@1115 = ~Umm... Minsc, I'm not sure how to tell you this...~ [FWKETOB0]
@1116 = ~Later, Keto! I have lost Boo, and it is as though my two arms are gone! A leg, too! Yes, hopping along, crying and unable to wield a sword or even an evil-beating stick is Minsc without Boo!~
@1117 = ~Minsc, stop the hysterics. I have Boo.~
@1118 = ~What?! We always thought you had a heart of goodness! You would stoop to hamster-napping poor Boo?~
@1119 = ~Shame! Shame! Return him, apologize, and I will cease shaming you.~
@1120 = ~Knock it off. I didn't steal him.~
@1121 = ~He smelled something in my wine bottle. I wasn't paying attention and left the cork out, and, um... he fell in. Little bugger sure can squeeze himself tight when he wants to.~
@1122 = ~But Boo does not drink!~
@1123 = ~Well, LOOK, will you? See? Oh, the little bastard's enjoying himself.~
@1124 = ~BOO! Oh, no, he is drowning! Look at how purple he is!~
@1125 = ~I think that has more to do with the fact he's in a bottle of wine, Minsc.~
@1126 = ~We have to save him! Give it to me, I will break free my innocent hamster from inebriated doom!~
@1127 = ~NO!~
@1128 = ~I mean... uh...you might... um... get some glass onto Boo! Don't want to do that, do you?~
@1129 = ~What? No, I could never risk cutting Boo. But time runs short, like a little hamster's air supply!~
@1130 = ~Well, he squeezed himself in there, I'm sure he can squeeze himself back out.~
@1131 = ~Good thinking, little bard! Here, give that to me!~
@1132 = ~But--~
@1133 = ~Ride the wave to freedom, Boo!~
@1134 = ~Oh, the waste! I can't watch.~
@1135 = ~Boo! Come now, back into the safety of Minsc's hands!~
@1136 = ~So give me my wine bottle back... thank you.~
@1137 = ~All is as it should be, Boo! Minsc has rescued you, and will not let you fall in again.~
@1138 = ~He looks disappointed.~
@1139 = ~Nonsense. He looks purple, and I am sure he will stop hiccuping after he forgets this tragic ordeal!~
@1140 = ~Won't you, Boo?~
@1141 = ~Of course.~
@1142 = ~Damn. Now I have to find a refill.~
@1143 = ~Mazzy? Could I interrupt your thoughts a moment?~ [FWKETOB1]
@1144 = ~Of course, my friend. What do you need?~
@1145 = ~Do you ever get scared when we're fighting?~
@1146 = ~The fear that a battle will be my last does not frighten me as much as the thought of losing a companion, or the gravity of our foes succeeding.~
@1147 = ~If my death will ensure us victory and a triumph over evil, I will not fear it.~
@1148 = ~That's a very courageous outlook, Mazzy.~
@1149 = ~You smile, Keto, but still seem sad. What troubles you?~
@1150 = ~It's nothing. It's just good to know you're on our side, heh.~
@1151 = ~Keto, I have had the good fortune of avoiding all but a mere handful of bards in the past, but after spending time in your company, I have reached a conclusion.~
@1152 = ~That you wish you'd taken up the zitar as a child?~ [FWKETOB2]
@1153 = ~No, daft one, I mean that despite all your claims of talent and ingenuity, you are, in fact, equally useless at everything.~
@1154 = ~Edwin, do you HAVE any friends, or did you blow them all up?~
@1155 = ~Friends? Hmmph. Nothing but a nuisance and a waste of energy. Among the rabble and vagrants found outside Thay, the best one could hope for is a companion inevitably driven mad with jealousy by my unparalleled genius, or incapable of understanding my brilliance.~
@1156 = ~But, Edwin, there's nobody here but us vagrants. And we're not jealous.~
@1157 = ~Away from me, girl! I tire of wasting breath on my inferiors.~
@1158 = ~Hungry, Nalia?~ [FWKETOB3]
@1159 = ~What do you have there?~
@1160 = ~A sandwich. I think.~
@1161 = ~A little soggy, but definitely edible. Oh, did you want one?~
@1162 = ~That just looks unhealthy. Where did you get it?~
@1163 = ~Oh, from the cart over there. Pretty cheap.~
@1164 = ~You mean you actually eat things you can buy off the street?~
@1165 = ~Better than listening to my stomach growl while waiting on <CHARNAME> to hit a tavern.~
@1166 = ~Oh, I would never... I mean, enjoy your sandwich if you possibly can, but I would be too concerned for my well-being.~
@1167 = ~Heh, if I spent too much time worrying over my health, I would never have gone into adventuring.~
@1168 = ~Minsc, I have to admit you *are* an incredible sight in battle.~ [FWKETOB4]
@1169 = ~So long as evil knows it has been smacked about the head and neck with the fist of justice, Minsc is content.~
@1170 = ~Oh, Boo says that I am very practiced with hurting evil, which may be what impresses you.~
@1171 = ~Maybe, but I've never seen someone that could throw themselves into the fray so... ah... haplessly.~
@1172 = ~I just swing with the fury of the good and right, and show evil no fear! For Minsc and Boo *have* no fear of those that do injustice!~
@1173 = ~If it works. I think I'll stay in the back, though.~
@1174 = ~No shame in keeping away from breathing down evil's neck, though you do miss all the righteous punching and kicking. A bolt in the buttocks is as good as a fist to the nose, and Boo says that staying in back is safer for nice girls.~
@1175 = ~Umm, yes... I just don't want anyone thinking me a coward. I'm sensitive, y'know.~
@1176 = ~I have to say, though, that I do feel better knowing that anything that wants to get to me has to go through you, first.~
@1177 = ~Boo says that is all part of the glory of heroes--protecting friends from the dirty stabs of enemies.~
@1178 = ~No, sir! No infected wounds for good people so long as Boo and Minsc boldly lead with blade and boot!~
@1179 = ~Thanks, Minsc.~
@1180 = ~Boo is curious, Keto. Why do you carry wine as closely to yourself as a ranger would his hamster?~
@1181 = ~It's a battle-aid, naturally. It keeps me from running away.~ [FWKETOB5]
@1182 = ~But why would you run away from delivering butt-kickings in the name of goodness?~
@1183 = ~Well, see, evil did a lot of butt-kicking to my person when I first began adventuring, and, really, courage only stems from stupidity, pride, intoxication... or frequent practice, I suppose.~
@1184 = ~Minsc practices butt-kicking all the time!~
@1185 = ~"Boot three evil things before breakfast!" That's what Boo says!~
@1186 = ~Of course. But I'm smart enough to know dying is bad. My first adventuring days would have humbled anyone's pride, and I certainly don't have much practice, so that leaves one recourse: hitting the bottle until danger doesn't seem so dangerous.~
@1187 = ~A strange theory, but Minsc understands.~
@1188 = ~Oh, but Boo thinks we should help you build more bravery! Though you seem coherent, we worry about you falling on the battlefield, squashed by grapes rather than enemies.~
@1189 = ~How do you plan on teaching me courage?~
@1190 = ~The same way Minsc was taught! You will come to the front line, with Minsc and Boo!~
@1191 = ~Honestly, I can't afford to buy a new pair of pants after every battle. Maybe sometime later... in the very far-flung future.~
@1192 = ~In the future, Minsc and Boo will have many evil buttocks to poke with things sharp and painful, and you, little bard, will busy writing songs and words of glory about our deeds! Still, we will try, since everyone deserves great feats under their belt.~
@1193 = ~Or bottle.~
@1194 = ~Mazzy, however did you manage to get your hair to do that?~ [FWKETOB6]
@1195 = ~Hmm? My sister and I have always styled our hair this way. It makes it very simple to look after, and keeps it away from my face in battle.~
@1196 = ~Not to mention that it looks very nice. Think you could teach me?~
@1197 = ~I could, my friend, but I'm not certain you would like it. If you wish, I will see what I can do when next we stop to rest.~
@1198 = ~Ow!~ [FWKETOB7]
@1199 = ~More blasted whining! Do yer poor litte feet hurt now?~
@1200 = ~No, I just managed to pick up a splinter in my thumb.~
@1201 = ~I can just hack it off for ye. Take care o' that right quick.~
@1202 = ~I doubt you're precise enough with an axe to cut out a splinter.~
@1203 = ~An' did I say anything about cutting out the splinter? I meant the whole damn thumb, girlie.~
@1204 = ~Hold it out. Just one good swing, an' yer splinter's a goner...~
@1205 = ~No, that's... quite all right. I'll be keeping all body parts a good distance from you, thanks.~
@1206 = ~Tuneless one, I only e'er met one creature could run from a fight as fast as you.~
@1207 = ~Do I even want to know?~ [FWKETOB8]
@1208 = ~Ye'll hear it, regardless. We listen to yer tales and jabber enough.~
@1209 = ~Were an old acquaintance o' mine. Fertesh the Fleet-Footed he called himself, though we called him "Weak-Bladder" quick enough, as that were proven long afore his speed.~
@1210 = ~He proved his cowardice during a dust-up at the old Courtesan's Chest Inn. Innkeep and most o' the patrons were safely dead, I was just mindin' me own business havin' a little fun with one o' the barmaids.~
@1211 = ~One thrice-damned bastard stops pretending to be dead and starts waving his hands an' casting some spell at us.~
@1212 = ~Weak-Bladder was scared o' spellflingers worst of all, so he wets himself and makes a run fer the door. Had a clean shot at the wizard's kidneys, but the arsewart makes to save his own hide.~
@1213 = ~Well, look, I already know the story won't end with the wizard blasting your head off, so I know it can't end any way I like; get on with it.~
@1214 = ~Watch yer words, girlie, you'll be eating them off the keen edge of me axe soon.~
@1215 = ~So the Bladder's gone. So I have to drop me wench and throw an axe at the wizard. Stopped his tongue mid-waggle, it did.~
@1216 = ~'Twas in his head but not too deep, so one nimble motion and I yank the axe out o' his skull and send it spinnin' at Fertesh.~
@1217 = ~Ye would have been proud o' yer fellow coward. He was already out the door, half cross the road.~
@1218 = ~Might've made it the other half, too, but fer the axe splittin' his spine.~
@1219 = ~Korgan, I hope you make these things up just to try and scare people.~
@1220 = ~Do ye now? What do ye think, then?~
@1221 = ~I think I'll be sleeping with one eye fixed on you, that's for certain.~
@1222 = ~Yer no use to me sleepin'. Watch yer back the next time you go runnin', though. Never know what ye might find sticking out of it.~
@1223 = ~So who was this fianc of yours supposed to be, Nalia?~ [FWKETOB9]
@1224 = ~Isaea Roenall, a despicable weasel of a man.~
@1225 = ~I should hope you never have the displeasure of meeting him.~
@1226 = ~Is he good-looking?~
@1227 = ~What does that have to do with anything?~
@1228 = ~I'm just curious.~
@1229 = ~No, he isn't, and he has barely any premise of social graces to make up for it. The thought of having to marry HIM is nothing but sickening.~
@1230 = ~Ach. So he's brainless, amoral, unfriendly, and ugly to boot?~
@1231 = ~Wait. Are you saying that you missed the confrontation I had with that vile, smarmy beanpole of a man?~
@1232 = ~I remember some yelling. Is that what it was? I think that was when I found some cork in my bottle. Getting the bugger out must have distracted me.~
@1233 = ~Was that what the chugging was about?~
@1234 = ~Bullseye. So, right. You were saying he's brainless, amoral, unfriendly, and ugly to boot?~
@1235 = ~Hmmm. Seems to describe everyone with money and title.~
@1236 = ~Oh, really?~
@1237 = ~Uh... present company excluded. Of course.~
@1238 = ~I'm sure.~
@1239 = ~...and it's no, nay, never.
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the wild rover
No nay never no more...~ [FWKETOC0]
@1240 = ~Now there's a lie.~
@1241 = ~Ach, Nalia, you interrupted my rhythm!~
@1242 = ~What little there was to be had.~
@1243 = ~Oh, now you're just trying to get me worked up. Calling me a liar, too, now? Have at you!~
@1244 = ~Hah! Quit that! I am simply saying you will doubtless never stop "roving."~
@1245 = ~I can sing about it, though, can't I? Besides, I'll stop travelling someday. Some kobold's bound to bite off my kneecaps eventually.~
@1246 = ~Madam, please...? Just a few coins to ease a man's suffering?~ [KETOBEG0]
@1247 = ~Of course...~
@1248 = ~Here, and good health to you.~
@1249 = ~Nalia!~ [FWKETOC1]
@1250 = ~What, Keto, would you have me walk on and pay no attention?~
@1251 = ~First, that gold belongs to the party, second, you're doing no good by handing off money to anyone that asks.~
@1252 = ~No good? I have given a poor man a chance to eat a proper meal. That is not doing any good? I hardly see the logic in that.~
@1253 = ~It doesn't teach them to make a way for themselves. If begging works for them, why would they ever stop? Having the poor waste away their lives draining others is NOT a good thing.~
@1254 = ~But there's nothing for them. Society has fenced in the lower classes, making it impossible for them to better themselves.~
@1255 = ~So you're saying the poor have nothing of value to support themselves with?~
@1256 = ~No! Of course not! I'm just saying it's very hard for them. Keto, you don't understand what it is like to be what none of the upper class want to admit exists. By shutting them out, you only compound the problem.~
@1257 = ~I would know far better than you would.~
@1258 = ~I've spent most of my life helping the poor--~
@1259 = ~--And I've spent my life AS one of the poor!~
@1260 = ~Nalia, I started on this road with no money, no home, no family, and no name for myself. Through necessity and no small amount of luck, I've made my own way.~
@1261 = ~There's no reason in all the planes that any one of these people couldn't do the same.~
@1262 = ~You don't act like one of the poor.~
@1263 = ~You mean it's hard to tell that I'm just one of the nameless poor when I don't crawl to a noble's doorstep begging for table scraps?~
@1264 = ~That is NOT what I meant! I'm tired of these insinuations, Keto, and I'll not stop lending a helping hand!~
@1265 = ~I don't know why my efforts make you so bitter, but if it makes you feel better, I'll not discuss them any further with you.~
@1266 = ~Kills most of your topics of conversation, then, doesn't it?~
@1267 = ~It is a shame that no one came to your aid when you were alone and destitute, Keto. Perhaps it would have made you more gracious.~
@1268 = ~Are you all right, Viconia? Your eyes bothering you?~ [FWKETOC3]
@1269 = ~Nothing requires your help, unless you intend to extinguish that hellfire.~
@1270 = ~Well, here, I think I've got a scarf. Hood it over your eyes and it'll keep the sun out.~
@1271 = ~I said it is none of your concern. Keep your filthy rags to yourself, vagabond!~
@1272 = ~Hey, no need for shame. There's nothing wrong with getting a little help from your comrades--~
@1273 = ~Shame is a vicious playmate best suited for the weak, bard. Do not speak of it to me.~
@1274 = ~You... I travel with you because <CHARNAME> wills it. Were it my choice, you would be tied to a tree at roadside, left as a chew toy for wandering gibberlings.~
@1275 = ~I am long-since weary of your daft comments, pointless stories, and your fool notion that we can be "friends."~
@1276 = ~Fine, then! Let the sun burn your eyes from your skull for all I care!~
@1277 = ~So you *are* capable of getting the point.~
@1278 = ~(Keto plays the pipes)~ [FWKETOC5]
@1279 = ~That's a pretty tune, Keto.~
@1280 = ~Hmm? Oh, thanks Aerie.~
@1281 = ~Picked it up in... eh, I don't remember. Somewhere. So it's the Somewhere Song, if you ever want to hear it again.~
@1282 = ~It's very nice. Why don't you sing more?~
@1283 = ~I'd have thought it obvious.~
@1284 = ~Hmm?~
@1285 = ~Heh, I'm bad at it, Aerie.~
@1286 = ~No!~
@1287 = ~I-I mean, you may think your voice is flawed, Keto, but you're a professional entertainer. You must have high standards.~
@1288 = ~How do I break it to you...? Performing on the road, my singing has been called pretty much everything...~
@1289 = ~Except "professional." And I've got the rotten fruit to prove it.~
@1290 = ~That's terrible! people really reacted that way?~
@1291 = ~You'd be surprised what drunk tavern patrons do to bad entertainers.~
@1292 = ~Oh, my...~
@1293 = ~Aerie, you're taking me too seriously. Really, it's fine... I just don't sing. At least, not if I'm trying to make any coin.~
@1294 = ~I'd still like to hear you sometime... if that's all right. (giggle) I won't throw anything at you.~
@1295 = ~Heh, but you are a brave one! Aye, aye, you'll hear me sing someday sure enough, though I bet the rest of the group won't appreciate your request.~
@1296 = ~Ach, the most frustrating kind of story... the one we know would captivate an audience, if only we could tell it!~
@1297 = ~Still, it suits you, if that brings any comfort.~
@1298 = ~And what of "Keto," then? I have not heard it before.~
@1299 = ~It is a name and functions as such.~
@1300 = ~I do not care. My actions determine my standing, not my name.~
@1301 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. I'll ask you some other time, aye?~
@1302 = ~Aye, I agree. You've certainly come a long way, and it takes no small bit of resolve to do what you have. <CHARNAME> fits you.~
@1303 = ~I am glad you approve. And Keto seems to fit you, though I have no clue what it means.~
@1304 = ~Ooo, flattery, it tingles. So why the name analysis?~
@1305 = ~Strength has always been a way of life for me. I doubt it has much to do with my name.~
@1306 = ~Thank you. It's easier to keep my courage knowing that it's in my name.~
@1307 = ~I'm so happy you approve. Would you go away now and stop speaking?~
@1308 = ~Really? That's interesting. It conjures up a very powerful image.~
@1309 = ~I like it. It's nice to feel associated with an awe-inspiring creature. What does yours mean? I have not heard it before.~
@1310 = ~Yeah. I just wish I could devour people in a single gulp. (sigh) Damn misleading nomenclature.~
@1311 = ~As, I would hope, do I. Is that not the point of having names?~
@1312 = ~If it does so for me, then all the better. I am not sure why I should care, though.~
@1313 = ~I'll be "conjuring" a knot on your blathering skull if you don't hush.~
@1314 = ~Oh, that fits, for sure. I would've been completely lost trying to deal with that Sarevok fellow. You must have a good head on your shoulders.~
@1315 = ~You are too kind. Despite what my name indicates, I am not always exactly sure of what I am doing.~
@1316 = ~Surprisingly. Sometimes I wake up in shock that I still have the thing attached. I'm not so sure about the "wise" thing, really.~
@1317 = ~Wisdom is something much treasured by those who have heard the call, as I have. But it is rarely found, and certainly not found in something as simple as a name.~
@1318 = ~I try. It is not always easy, but I manage.~
@1319 = ~Too bad you don't. Keep quiet until you have something interesting to say.~
@1320 = ~Lionhearted. Heh, it has a good ring to it. Sounds like the name of a hero, for certain.~
@1321 = ~Name of a hero... well, I can hope. Time will tell, in any case.~
@1322 = ~Terribly fitting, then! And what does yours mean, Keto? I presume it is something more interesting than "bard."~
@1323 = ~It may not seem the most original, but it serves me well.~
@1324 = ~Or the name of someone that has better things to do than listen to a whelp spout her nonsense.~
@1325 = ~Conqueror... hmm. Well, I haven't ever seen you defeated, and it's a strong name. Very nice.~
@1326 = ~I like it. I think it represents my ambition.~
@1327 = ~Eh, it is a little harsh for my tastes. I'd much rather have it mean "buttercup" or "rainbow."~
@1328 = ~Thank you. And what of your own name, Keto?~
@1329 = ~Yes, it is. I knew all that already. Why do you care?~
@1330 = ~And I am a strong <PRO_MANWOMAN>, and will prove it if you continue these inane interruptions.~
@1331 = ~A ruler, hmm? Aye, you surely rule this group well enough, and nobility is a common wish bestowed on children.~
@1332 = ~True. It does sound like something my foster father would have wanted for me. I hope I live up to it.~
@1333 = ~Too bad I completely ruin the image, being little more than a wandering, adventuring, rootless vagabond. (grin)~
@1334 = ~Common, yes, but one's name is not always the absolute truth, Keto.~
@1335 = ~Great. I love being analyzed by a bard that can't even get her head out of her wine most of the time.~
@1336 = ~Would you shut up? I don't care.~
@1337 = ~Nightfall... heh, just slightly foreboding. Hardly a bad name, though.~
@1338 = ~I don't really think it means anything special. But it sounds intriguing.~
@1339 = ~Yes, anyone with a name meaning "nightfall" is clearly some horrid deathbringer. It is just a name, Keto.~
@1340 = ~What's wrong with it? It means "night," not "demonic." A name doesn't determine some absolute truth.~
@1341 = ~Right. Thanks. I could never recover if you did not approve.~
@1342 = ~Thank you for the idiotic analysis. Pipe down.~
@1343 = ~I can see why. Very prophetic kind of meaning, if not entirely positive. You don't live a boring life on calm waters, that is for certain.~
@1344 = ~Indeed. I do feel like I'm caught up in a hurricane. You think it is caused by my name?~
@1345 = ~Not for a long time, at any rate. I remember wishing *something* interesting would happen, and I got that in spades. What's the story behind "Keto"?~
@1346 = ~Absolutely. I have lived up to it. Why the interest?~
@1347 = ~I don't care if it is positive or not. It works well enough for me.~
@1348 = ~If you keep blathering, I will show you a rising storm.~
@1349 = ~Nor do any of us as of late, I think. Oh, but I meant no offense; this has been quite the trip, to be sure.~
@1350 = ~No offense taken, Keto. But why the interest in my name?~
@1351 = ~No kidding. So what do you think the meaning of <CHARNAME> has to do with it?~
@1352 = ~And I have no doubt it will continue to be so. What brought on the interest in names?~
@1353 = ~And it will not be a peaceful trip for quite a while, no matter what my name might say.~
@1354 = ~That's enough. I don't care to listen to this any longer.~
@1355 = ~Nothing wrong with that. Besides, it indicates more than you would think. You seem to travel a rocky path now.~
@1356 = ~No offense, just an observation.~
@1357 = ~I understand. And I suppose you are right. I never thought about it that way.~
@1358 = ~Somehow, I don't think that's what Gorion was thinking of when he named me <CHARNAME>. I think it is just what I'm called.~
@1359 = ~I manage fine. Although not everyone who is "on a rocky path" has a name that indicates it.~
@1360 = ~That is a pretty obscure connection. Where are you getting this gibberish from?~
@1361 = ~I cannot describe how much I appreciate your opinion, Keto. Get off it and shut up, will you?~
@1362 = ~Heh, oh, come on now, it's a good meaning! You don't like it?~ ~I happen to think love is a beautiful concept and makes for a beautiful name, but not everyone understands.~
@1363 = ~It could be worse, but it does sometimes provoke a chuckle; like just now, for instance. Why did you want to know, anyway?~
@1364 = ~It is not exactly intimidating, or even remotely respectable. I mean, really. "Ho, there, I am <CHARNAME>, love incarnate!" Would that have *you* fearful?~
@1365 = ~I might like something a little more... ah... substantial, but it is a fine enough name. Most people don't know the meaning, thank heavens.~
@1366 = ~On the contrary, I wish everyone were as fortunate as I, to have a name that stands for something so universal. What of your name?~
@1367 = ~No, it isn't, and no, I don't. I suppose yours is something much better?~
@1368 = ~Oh, shut up, would you?~
@1369 = ~I was just curious.~
@1370 = ~"Wolf", hmm? So is it referring to "lone wolf" or "wolf pack", or just to a predator or hunter?~
@1371 = ~Why does it matter, Keto? It is just a name, isn't it?~
@1372 = ~It could just refer to my habit of sneaking away from the party at night to devour a cow and attack farmers. Really, Keto, it's just a name because I had to be named for *something*.~
@1373 = ~It represents everything that is best in me, I think. Strength, loyalty, perseverance. And what does your name represent?~
@1374 = ~I think of myself more in terms of being <CHARNAME>, not being a wolf.~
@1375 = ~Quiet down, I don't care for your analysis in the least.~
@1376 = ~Really? Hmm... <CHARNAME>... I'm not positive, but I think it means "one who has been made divine," or something similar. Might have been "immortal" or "great" or along those lines, though.~
@1377 = ~That fits better than you would think, Keto. Why did you want to know?~
@1378 = ~Well, then you know a thing or three more than I do about me. Why does it matter to you?~
@1379 = ~Quite odd. I hardly think it bears much thinking about, however.~
@1380 = ~Isn't that lovely? Who knew what little bits of wisdom lurked in my name?~
@1381 = ~You seem to know so much about my name, but I don't know anything about yours.~
@1382 = ~I have no interest in talking about this. Bug off, bard.~
@1383 = ~Right, I was wondering if there was anything behind it. It's always interesting when someone chooses a name for <PRO_HISHER>self, you know. It shows you what image <PRO_HESHE> wants to project on those who hear it.~
@1384 = ~Obvious enough. Why such interest?~
@1385 = ~That is why you see few name themselves "The Pathetic" or "The Donkey." Speaking of which, I cannot say I have ever met any others named "Keto."~
@1386 = ~It is a name. It functions well enough as such.~
@1387 = ~I don't really care what sort of image my name produces. I command respect in other ways.~
@1388 = ~Thank you for that completely irrelevant bit of trivia. Shut up, now. That's not any sort of request.~
@1389 = ~I'm sorry, I wasn't meaning to bother you. I just thought it might make for good conversation.~
@1390 = ~I made my name up, for the most part. I'm not sure what it means.~
@1391 = ~It is a little odd to give yourself a name without some idea of what it is.~
@1392 = ~If you are happy with it, then that is all that matters.~
@1393 = ~Why are you so evasive all of a sudden? I'm just trying to make conversation, like you.~
@1394 = ~Was your given name so bad that you had to make a more tolerable one?~
@1395 = ~Really? I wouldn't think "Keto" as being the kind of name that just springs to mind.~
@1396 = ~So why ask me about the meaning of my name, if you don't even know what yours is?~
@1397 = ~Well, it's because...oh, honestly, you have the right to know.~
@1398 = ~(sigh) What happened is that I lost my memory a few years ago.~
@1399 = ~The last thing I can almost recall is a word. I think it was my name, but I couldn't quite understand, so... I got as close to it as I could.~
@1400 = ~That is a rather distressing way to get a name. I take it no one has recognized you as "Keto"?~
@1401 = ~I am sorry for you. Have you not tried to have your memory restored at a temple? Divine magic can do such things.~
@1402 = ~And what of "Riven"? How did you come by a family name, then?~
@1403 = ~You met no one who knew you after the incident?~
@1404 = ~How did this happen?~
@1405 = ~I find that a little hard to believe. There was *no* clue as to your identity?~
@1406 = ~When I woke up, I was at the foot of a cliff. I had suffered some bumps and bruises, but I was alone, so no telling if they only came from the fall or if there was a fight. I made my way to a farming village a few miles off, and no one there knew me.~
@1407 = ~No one I've come across has recognized me, either. I'm beginning to despair of ever figuring it out.~
@1408 = ~Don't lose hope. I am sure your old family and friends are looking for you even now. Speaking of which... how did you come by a family name?~
@1409 = ~Have you not tried to have your memory restored at a temple? Divine magic can do such things.~
@1410 = ~Look on the bright side, you have still accomplished more than most people. I wonder, though, where your family name stems from if you cannot remember your family.~
@1411 = ~And I suppose you expect me to fall over myself with pity for you?~
@1412 = ~I've... considered it, aye. It's not really something I want to pursue, though. I'm not sure I *want* to know what really happened. Would be a waste of a miracle to tell me something I don't want to know.~
@1413 = ~But, really, enough of that. I didn't mean to turn the discussion to depressing subjects.~
@1414 = ~I enjoy hearing about the people I travel with. But the story is incomplete. Where does "Riven" stem from?~
@1415 = ~Then silence yourself before I tire of your stories.~
@1416 = ~Let us dwell on this no longer, then.~
@1417 = ~"Riven"? That... was just a nickname. Given by the people I first stayed with. None of it really means anything, as near as I can tell.~
@1418 = ~It doesn't have to mean anything. It's only a name.~
@1419 = ~So is that what your interest stems from? Not knowing the meaning of your own name?~
@1420 = ~Does it matter if it means anything? A name is a name is a name, isn't it?~
@1421 = ~It is not such a bad thing. What does a name determine, really?~
@1422 = ~I am not sure what to say, Keto. I am sorry you have had such a bad run of luck.~
@1423 = ~It's always been something of a hobby for me, I suppose. I love knowing where a person's name came from, and what it says about them.~
@1424 = ~Ah, because you know nothing of your own? What influence do you think it holds, then?~
@1425 = ~Well, given your history--er, lack thereof--it makes sense. I can't say I consider it all that important, though.~
@1426 = ~In that case, just to be fair, what is the story behind yours?~
@1427 = ~That is an interesting way to get to know people. Of course, you know I have to ask you about your name now, right?~
@1428 = ~I don't think it says much. I think you put too much stock in such things.~
@1429 = ~Now you know. Add <CHARNAME> to your catalog, and let us move on for now.~
@1430 = ~I don't think a name completely rules a person's life, but I believe it carries influence. I see one's first name as being a mark of where you were meant to go, and the family name as a sign of where you've been, by blood...~
@1431 = ~Of course, names change, and you and pick and choose it and choose your own destiny, if you'd rather. It all sounds a bit odd, I know, but it does make for some incredible stories.~
@1432 = ~Yes. Well, we know each other's names. That is enough for now.~
@1433 = ~It is not odd at all. Many a mage has discovered the power that a name holds. Or do you not mean this in a purely mystical sense?~
@1434 = ~It has been said that the gods choose our names for us, and we but live out the roles set before us, though 'tis not always a pleasant task. What do you believe has been laid out for yourself, Keto?~
@1435 = ~Perhaps that means you have been given a chance to determine your own destiny.~
@1436 = ~What does that mean for you, then, Keto? What destiny is written in your name?~
@1437 = ~So are you trying to discern my destiny with this hobby of yours, then?~
@1438 = ~How long have you been examining names so closely, anyway?~
@1439 = ~It bears thinking about. Thank you for the interesting discussion, Keto.~
@1440 = ~Wow, <CHARNAME>, I didn't know simple conversation bothered you so much. Aye, I'll turn my attention to someone less bristly, if you prefer.~
@1441 = ~I expected you might have enough interest to listen. I'll turn my attention to someone less bristly, if you prefer.~
@1442 = ~It's been a pleasure talking to you, <CHARNAME>. Glad you aren't adverse to a bit of conversation.~
@1443 = ~I've tried thinking of it that way. It's an inspiring thought, isn't it? A lot better than moping about the whole thing.~
@1444 = ~It just bothers me. I've no past, and I'm not always sure I have much of a future.~
@1445 = ~Anyway. I didn't mean to turn the conversation to depressing topics, <CHARNAME>, I really just meant for this to be a simple talk.~
@1446 = ~It is no trouble, Keto. It is good to hear more about you. I will be here to listen whenever you like.~
@1447 = ~Simple talk from simple minds. This little chat is over.~
@1448 = ~Do not apologize. You have come to your hobby in a sad way, but, then, I have developed a predilection for reading tombstones. It happens.~
@1449 = ~I would prefer happier topics myself, but you are right, it is good to talk. Especially when we need to be looking out for each other.~
@1450 = ~You're a nice girl, Keto, but I really have had enough of listening to everyone's sob stories. I have my own problems.~
@1451 = ~It is not as bad as you think. Your memory may yet return. In the meantime, you can better yourself, and do things you might never have been able to before. Not everyone gets that chance. Not everything can be reclaimed.~
@1452 = ~Have patience, Keto. And do not fear speaking out. It is my duty to tend to troubled spirits, including yours.~
@1453 = ~Not as such, no. I'm mostly just curious. It's something to do that doesn't involve bloodshed, at any rate, aye?~
@1454 = ~I suppose, though I'm not sure how much I like being measured by my companions. Watch yourself, Keto.~
@1455 = ~So how has your own name compared to *your* life? It seems to me like that would be the most logical place to start looking.~
@1456 = ~If it keeps you entertained, Keto. Everyone needs their pastime. Mine, for instance, seems to be saving everyone and everything from some threat or another, but I have often thought about taking up the piccolo. ~
@1457 = ~As long as you are with me, whatever meaning my name carries is added to yours, and your own unique personality, my bard. Come, then, there is much to see and do.~
@1458 = ~It makes for some interesting conversation. It is about time to move on, though.~
@1459 = ~I know you have your own problems. I wasn't trying to put mine on you, <CHARNAME>, I just thought you deserved to know who you were traveling with. I won't bother you again.~
@1460 = ~I--of course, <CHARNAME>, that's not what I intended. I meant no offense.~
@1461 = ~Oh, don't worry about it. I wasn't trying to sour the conversation. I just thought you had a right to know some things about who you travel with.~
@1462 = ~"Sorrow"? That"s not an easy name to live with. But, more than most, I suppose you've had your share of it and then some.~
@1463 = ~My name is not a label. I do not feel obligated to live up to its meaning.~
@1464 = ~Honestly, don't you find it a bit grim? I far prefer the "sunshine and happiness" sort of prophecy fulfillment, but then, <CHARNAME> does have uses for inducing swoons of sympathy among my admirers.~
@1465 = ~If only it were a less accurate description of my life's course. I worry for the lives I touch.~
@1466 = ~Yes, well. Some days it fits like a glove and other days I think it is more a warning to my enemies. Turnabout is fair play; how about your own name?~
@1467 = ~I don't like the direction this discussion is taking. Kindly stop prying.~
@1468 = ~A flame? Hmm... could be that of creativity... or of destruction... how do you take it to mean?~
@1469 = ~In all honesty, I have always found it too flamboyant for my tastes.~
@1470 = ~Surely it is the flame of passion I kindle in the hearts of all who see me. Oh, you do not agree? Drat. You have no idea how long I have been saving that line.~
@1471 = ~Creativity, I hope. I seek to be an inspiration, not a force of destruction.~
@1472 = ~The flame consumes, the flame renews... it is all the same to me.~
@1473 = ~I rather think it suits me in both senses, and I like it that way. So, how about you?~
@1474 = ~Surely my name does not have anything to do with how I choose to influence the world around me.~
@1475 = ~Maybe it's just related to my habit of setting afire people who pry too deeply into my private affairs.~
@1476 = ~A lovely name, to be sure, though I wonder how you view it...considering all the hardships you've borne, and all that you've lost...~
@1477 = ~It is a name...it serves as a convenience. I certainly have not felt particularly "beloved" for most of my life.~
@1478 = ~You have no idea how difficult it is to keep my admirers from laying siege to every inn I happen to stop at. Damned inconvenient to walk over all the tokens of affection tossed at my feet.~
@1479 = ~It is entirely too ironic, yet I try to take it as a hopeful omen.~
@1480 = ~Perhaps in time I will find a way to make it more true. What lurks in your name, Keto?~
@1481 = ~You are absolutely right. I have been deprived. Want me to show you how prone it has made me to hair-trigger violence?~
@1482 = ~Heh! Very nice; you do attract attention wherever you go.~
@1483 = ~Aren't you putting a lot of weight on a few simple syllables, Keto?~
@1484 = ~So you have noticed it too? I do have this talent for irresistibly drawing every eye, but sometimes I wonder if I am not actually drawing the attention of every nose. Life on the road is a hard, smelly thing.~
@1485 = ~Hah, I suppose that's true! I rather enjoy living up to it.~
@1486 = ~Perhaps it is just a little flashy for a child brought up in a scholarly retreat. How about you, Keto? Is there any particular significance to your name?~
@1487 = ~Maybe. That does not mean I particularly like drawing attention. How about you turn yours to something else, before I turn you myself?~
@1488 = ~A name with both courage and nobility in it, <CHARNAME>. You should be proud of it.~
@1489 = ~Perhaps that is true, though I have never given it much thought. What of your name, Keto?~
@1490 = ~I rather prefer to think of myself as a shadowy marauder. If I constantly protect anything, it's my purse, my tongue and my back.~
@1491 = ~Difficult though it has been sometimes, I really do strive to live up to that name.~
@1492 = ~If only it were more true. It seems to me that I have failed to protect others far too often in the course of my life.~
@1493 = ~If you think anyone is going to protect YOU if you insist on keeping up this inane line of interrogation, you"re sorely mistaken. Go pry into someone else's business.~
@1494 = ~I have always viewed it as something of a challenge to live up to. Guarding the safety and happiness of others is important to me; you have seen that.~
@1495 = ~Oops. Hold on, everyone!~ [FWKETOC7]
@1496 = ~If you have pulled up lame, perhaps we can finally end your suffering. I would even consider making it painless.~
@1497 = ~No such luck, Viconia. But I dropped an earring. Just help me look and we'll be on our way fast enough.~
@1498 = ~Oh, you were looking for this?~
@1499 = ~Ah, you found it!~
@1500 = ~Hey, careful, that's pretty fragile crystal.~
@1501 = ~Really. How impractical. And how clumsy of you to lose it.~
@1502 = ~Yes, I suppose. Now can I have it back?~
@1503 = ~But of course.~
@1504 = ~Oh. Look what I did.~ [PGBREAK2]
@1505 = ~Y-you--you...!~
@1506 = ~Lose your tongue, Keto? No, I suppose I wouldn't be so fortunate.~
@1507 = ~Your illness pleases me, Keto.~
@1508 = ~What? What're you talking about? I'm hale! I'm hearty!~ [FWKETOC8]
@1509 = ~But you've not prattled off useless trivia or some poorly-played attempt at humor in quite some time.~
@1510 = ~Since your natural state seems to be the babbling of irritating mediocrity, I assumed our travels had taken their toll.~
@1511 = ~They haven't. Promise.~
@1512 = ~How disappointing.~
@1513 = ~No, I've just found it more interesting to stare at rocks and beetles than give a go at exchanging pleasantries with you, Viconia.~
@1514 = ~Because you're not really pleasant at all.~
@1515 = ~Fascinating. Yes, I can see how a rock would be the only object capable of tolerating your attention.~
@1516 = ~There are a lot of places I'd like to travel to one of these days. Tethyr, perhaps, and Waterdeep. They probably don't know my tales down there, and I imagine I could learn a fair few.~ [FWKETOC9]
@1517 = ~I may even look into skirting the Underdark. If ever there was a hole of danger worthy of taking a glance into to earn a story, that would be the one!~ [FWKETOD0]
@1518 = ~Fool. In my homeland, not only would you find audiences less than receptive, you would likely find them torturing or eating you and placing your remains on display.~
@1519 = ~Then I would just have to stick close to you. You'd guide me through the rough spots, Underdark princess that you are, right?~
@1520 = ~Were you so foolish as to tempt them, given free will, I would most likely aid in your capture and humiliation.~
@1521 = ~(cough) Ah.~
@1522 = ~Wait. "Most likely aid," eh? You aren't developing a soft spot for me, are you?~
@1523 = ~Enough of your blood stains my clothing from tending to the fruits of your incompetence in combat. Walking away and leaving you to your fate would serve just as well.~
@1524 = ~Watch your feet, waela! Your clumsy blundering disrupts my concentration!~
@1525 = ~Sorry, Viconia, but my eyes don't glow in the dark.~ [FWKETOD1]
@1526 = ~Spare me your whining list of the inferiorities of rivvin. I am well-schooled in what you lack, ibleth jalil.~
@1527 = ~I know why you're so edgy. I've never been a thing that goes bump in the night, but if I was, I think would go for the one with the glowing red eyes first.~
@1528 = ~And that is why I use you as a shield, Keto.~
@1529 = ~I'll just be stumbling over there, then, thanks.~
@1530 = ~You will be more successful going *around* walls.~
@1531 = ~I know, I know, I just wasn't--~
@1532 = ~--Watching where you were walking, precisely. And what did you find more engrossing than the path in front of you?~
@1533 = ~Hmm? Oh, I was watching for an opportunity to trip you into a muck pile or something.~
@1534 = ~Nothing.~
@1535 = ~Don't glare at me like that. You know it makes me nervous.~
@1536 = ~For the love of--I was kidding!~
@1537 = ~It is good for you that I have come to expect no gravity from you, Keto.~
@1538 = ~Let us move on. And do watch your step.~
@1539 = ~What? Watch my--whoa!~
@1540 = ~What--you--!~
@1541 = ~You were warned.~
@1542 = ~Meh! At least *I* was kidding!~
@1543 = ~Are you all right, Aerie? Looked sick there for a moment.~ [FWKETOD2]
@1544 = ~Oh, I-I'm fine, Keto, but.. oh, just look over... over there.~
@1545 = ~A half-eaten bird? Disgusting, yes, quite.~
@1546 = ~The poor thing. Maybe I'm more more sensitive to such things. It's just sad that it will never be able to fly and sing again.~
@1547 = ~But it's just an--oh.~
@1548 = ~I think I understand now.~
@1549 = ~Do you? No... no, I don't think anyone can really understand.~
@1550 = ~I'm sorry, Keto, I'd rather not talk right now.~
@1551 = ~If you insist, Aerie, though I must say, melancholy doesn't really suit you.~
@1552 = ~Neither does this... this ugly, grounded form.~
@1553 = ~What're you looking at, Aerie?~ [FWKETOD3]
@1554 = ~Hmm? Oh, n-nothing, really.~
@1555 = ~Right. You were only gazing like a hooked fish looking back at his pond.~
@1556 = ~Oh, was it that? The blue necklace on the cart there?~
@1557 = ~Not the necklace, exactly. It just... it just reminded me of something.~
@1558 = ~Design looks a little Elven. Did you see designs like this back home?~
@1559 = ~S-sometimes. In engravings on the floors, the embroidery of our clothes. It's so simple, really...~
@1560 = ~I was just reminded--~
@1561 = ~Hey, now, nothing wrong with memories. Want me to get it for you? Can take it with us and gaze on it whenever you've time.~
@1562 = ~No, Keto, it's... it's all right. A necklace can't take me back to Faenya-Dail.~
@1563 = ~It might let you take a bit of it with you, hmm?~
@1564 = ~I take a bit of it with me everywhere, in my thoughts... I...~
@1565 = ~Can we go, now, please?~
@1566 = ~Ach. I'm sorry, Aerie.~
@1567 = ~Where do you hail from, Keto? I cannot quite place you from your manner.~
@1568 = ~Hmmm? Oh, I'm from the Dalelands.~ [FWKETOD4]
@1569 = ~Oh? That would make you rather far from home.~
@1570 = ~From which part of the Dalelands?~
@1571 = ~Sessrendale... hey, careful there, Jaheira, your armor's loose.~
@1572 = ~Oh? So it is.~
@1573 = ~Wouldn't do to have it come off in battle, heh?~
@1574 = ~It would not.~
@1575 = ~Now, then, which part of--~
@1576 = ~--Ow! Dammit! Second time today I've twisted my ankle just walking along!~
@1577 = ~You should be more cautious, girl. Here, let me see it.~
@1578 = ~No lasting damage, it seems.~
@1579 = ~Aye, you're right, was just a little trip-up.~
@1580 = ~All right. I'm done slowing down the group now. Shall we press on?~
@1581 = ~Yes, I suppose it would be best.~
@1582 = ~Keto, I would like to request a favor of you.~
@1583 = ~Aye, Mazzy? If I can help, I will.~ [FWKETOD5]
@1584 = ~Good! I am certain you can, and you will be given a chance to display your many talents.~
@1585 = ~Then I suppose I can hardly refuse, eh?~
@1586 = ~Yours is a good soul, Keto. Not so self-centered as some others of your art that I have encountered. It's a good trait.~
@1587 = ~Now, then. I would like to commission a story. I've listened to your tales as we travel, and heard you remark that you wish to learn new ones, correct?~
@1588 = ~Mazzy, please! It's what I do.~
@1589 = ~Then I can think of no new tale more worthy of your talents than one of the gallant adventurers who loyally fought beside me and paid the ultimate price to protect Imnesvale.~
@1590 = ~A story of my fallen comrades. My Patrick. I feel they should be remembered as more than names upon a hidden shrine.~
@1591 = ~Are you certain you want me to do this?~
@1592 = ~There could be no one else.~
@1593 = ~Then there isn't a force in Faerun that could keep me from honoring them with a tale, Mazzy. Tell me their story as we walk, and from there, I'll do what I can.~
@1594 = ~Keto, do not feel at all rushed in your art, but how goes the writing?~
@1595 = ~Hmm? Writing...?~ [FWKETOD6]
@1596 = ~Oh! Actually, I finished it last night. Here, I'll dig it out so you can look it over.~ [FWKETOD7]
@1597 = ~Excellent! Well done, Keto!~
@1598 = ~It's in here somewhere...~
@1599 = ~...umm...~
@1600 = ~...er...~
@1601 = ~Keto...~
@1602 = ~...uhh...~
@1603 = ~...Ah-hah! Here it is! Careful, now, watch the corners, that's a second-hand tome.~
@1604 = ~Wonderful, Keto! You had me worried for a moment. Now, let me see.~
@1605 = ~Keto, this is...~
@1606 = ~...um. Yes?~
@1607 = ~This is very good. I see where your imagination has taken certain liberties, but that was to be expected.~
@1608 = ~Truly, it conjures the memory of my friends better than I could speak. Thank you, goodwoman bard.~
@1609 = ~Would you like to share this with the rest of the group? It is your tale now, after all.~
@1610 = ~When all this is over. Heh, give them something to look forward to.~
@1611 = ~True enough. Very well. Keep this close to you, and I hope you will have tales of our own to add when our work is done.~
@1612 = ~Jaheira, as of late I've been remembering a tale I heard once, one which I think you may find interesting. Would you indulge me a little and listen?~ [FWKETOE1]
@1613 = ~So long as it does not disturb my concentration.~
@1614 = ~Wonderful!~
@1615 = ~So this would have been well over a hundred years back; not that it's terribly important, but it shows it was enough of a story to survive the trials of time. It concerns the life and love of a priestess of Sune, held in high regard for her beauty, wisdom, and inner strength.~
@1616 = ~She married a nobleman of no paltry power, held in great esteem, and also noted for his benevolence, wealth, and impeccable appearance.~
@1617 = ~Hmph. Such ideal couples are the usual centerpieces of these stories.~
@1618 = ~If you don't mind, Jaheira, you said you would listen.~
@1619 = ~Their life together was blissful for a number of years, until Cherlea's young husband fell to a mysterious ailment.~
@1620 = ~Avrion was dead within a week, despite Cherlea's desperate pleas to her goddess for aid. The culprit was revealed to be an assassin, a servant of Talona, who was able to slip a poison of terrible strength into Avrion's wine. He actually confessed after Avrion died, his mission completed, though his masters escaped exposure.~
@1621 = ~I suppose this is about Cherlea's quest for vengeance against those who slew her husband.~
@1622 = ~If that is the case, I have no need to hear the ending.~
@1623 = ~What? Oh, no, no, really, just listen and be surprised.~
@1624 = ~Anyway, Cherlea was inconsolable--she spent days wandering the halls of her manor, weeping and praying for some sort of answer. She allowed her appearance to lapse, ignored her duties, and was on the brink of losing her position within Sune's clergy, when an unusual vistor came to her door.~
@1625 = ~He was a world-weary traveller, a warrior, jaded from years of combat and enduring the worst the world has to offer, and weighted down with the burden of the death and chaos that ensnared him. He sought only shelter for the night, and a bit of healing.~
@1626 = ~Cherlea nearly turned him away, but forced herself to remember her manners, and allowed him a room. They spoke long into the night, and she found herself entranced by the stranger's tales of far-away places, foes battled to the last, and the trials meeting him at every turn.~
@1627 = ~She found herself sympathizing, and, more, empathizing with his loneliness and frustration at the world, and it frightened her. As her guest slept, Cherlea prayed more fervently to Sune than she had in months, begging her for help.~
@1628 = ~Sune answered. That night, Cherlea was granted an audience with the spirit of her dead husband. Avrion appeared to her wrapped in heavy chains, ghastly and pale as though he had not had any form of sustenance for months, and Cherlea nearly fainted from sorrow.~
@1629 = ~He explained to her that it was the chains of guilt he felt for leaving her alone that kept him bound, and the pain of seeing her so distraught that prevented him from moving forward. He pleaded with her to move on, to release him and go to one who needed her far more now.~
@1630 = ~Cherlea cried that she could never love another. Avrion merely smiled and pointed to the staircase. In a sad voice, he told her: "You already do."~
@1631 = ~He left her then. It took many hours of thought, but Cherlea brought herself to speak to the stranger. She tended his wounds, and invited him to stay.~
@1632 = ~And they lived happily ever after.~
@1633 = ~Er, that's my line, but yes.~
@1634 = ~And they lived happily ever after. The end.~
@1635 = ~That was... a well-told story, Keto, thank you.~
@1636 = ~I'd be glad to tell it again if you feel you missed the point.~
@1637 = ~Yes, I'm sure you would. Come, there are things to do.~
@1638 = ~Keto, you play a pretty tune in battle! Music worthy of beating evil by, all the time!~
@1639 = ~Thank you, Minsc. Glad you approve. Dare I ask if Boo agrees?~ [FWKETOE4]
@1640 = ~Oh, yes, Boo agrees whole-heartedly. Although Boo wonders why you don't play so pretty all the time. Do you save the effort for battle?~
@1641 = ~Hmmph!~
@1642 = ~Why are you walking off like a wet hamster from a bath? Was it something I said?~
@1643 = ~This idle wandering grows more tiresome by the minute! Me stomach be growling, and I'll nay be ignoring it much longer.~
@1644 = ~What, can't just bite the head off a bird, or maybe a slain foe?~ [FWKETOE5]
@1645 = ~Nay, bard, since ye asked I'll tell ye straight. Me favorite delicacy is a tender minstrel.~
@1646 = ~They nay do any work or put forth effort, so they're succulent as a newborn calf!~
@1647 = ~Ooo! Aerie, come look at this!~ [FWKETOE6]
@1648 = ~Hmmm? What is it, Keto?~
@1649 = ~Look at these feathers! Must've come from the nest right above here.~
@1650 = ~Oh, they're beautiful, Keto! I-I've never seen such a pure white before!~
@1651 = ~Hmm... hey, let me see your hair for a second.~
@1652 = ~Wh-what? All right...~
@1653 = ~Trust me.~
@1654 = ~There. Looks perfect.~
@1655 = ~Thank you... they're very pretty.~
@1656 = ~Nothing but thieves and vagabonds on all sides; why are so few willing to step forward and bring the streets back to the light?~
@1657 = ~Oh, plenty have stepped forward. Then they fell forward from the dagger in the back.~ [FWKETOE7]
@1658 = ~Then came the looting, the dumping of the body off the docks, and the ruffians going home, arguing about what they're going to do with a new suit of shiny plate mail, hardly used...~ [FWKETOE8]
@1659 = ~Save your humor for the incoherent drunkards who pay for it, Keto. The day will come when I, as a Knight of the Order, shall bring heinous criminals to justice.~
@1660 = ~Sounds great. When that day arrives, could you be sure to give me your armor before nightfall?~
@1661 = ~Truly, you are an honorless whelp, Keto.~
@1662 = ~Keto! Ah, just the person I need!~
@1663 = ~Never thought I'd see the day when I'd hear that from you, Anomen. To what do I owe the honor?~ [FWKETOF0]
@1664 = ~Aye, I've not been completely fair to you. But, Keto girl, you've been in the right all along.~
@1665 = ~Uh... I have?~
@1666 = ~Of course! Wine and travelling, good tales and better company, adventure and complete freedom.~
@1667 = ~You are tethered to no one, Keto; to think, all that time I was expecting you to follow my example. Hah! I should have been following yours.~
@1668 = ~Oh, Anomen, my lifestyle is good enough for me, but I don't think you should--~
@1669 = ~Don't disappoint me by trying to act as my conscience now. I had well enough of that from those damnable grandmothers in the Order.~
@1670 = ~Spare me, Keto, and pass over the wine bottle. I've years of thirst to quench.~
@1671 = ~Well.. I've never been one to hoard my liquor...~
@1672 = ~There's a good woman.~
@1673 = ~You seem a little gloomy today, Anomen. Like a man whose prize cock keeled over before even making it into the ring.~ [FWKETOF1]
@1674 = ~Hmm? Far from it, actually. I hardly see how life could be better, in fact.~
@1675 = ~This is an interesting change in you, I'll admit, but you must be an amazing actor, or...~
@1676 = ~Or *what*?~
@1677 = ~...Ah. N-nevermind.~
@1678 = ~Good. Now, perhaps a story, Keto? Aye, a tale of glorious battle will stir my blood!~
@1679 = ~Aye, indeed. (And everyone best stand clear when he's stirred...)~
@1680 = ~I suggest you watch your tongue closely, bard--it would be a shame to lose it, wouldn't you say?~
@1681 = ~In-indeed. I didn't mean it.~
@1682 = ~Of course not. Now, give me that story, girl, before I lose my patience!~
@1683 = ~Anomen, I'd give anything for you to call me an honorless, spineless, useless whelp again.~ [FWKETOF2]
@1684 = ~What sort of mindless blather is that, Keto?~
@1685 = ~Anomen, no one should just... just change as you have!~
@1686 = ~It's like... it's like you're just denying everything you wanted to be!~
@1687 = ~For the better! Aren't you the one that told me that the change would be for the better, before I even stepped foot inside that building?~
@1688 = ~Or were your words about luck and going to where I am meant to be more of your worthless platitudes?~
@1689 = ~I never said you'd actually be lucky!~
@1690 = ~Honestly, Anomen, are you *happy* like this? What is there for you to do, now?~
@1691 = ~To grasp every opportunity I let the Order deny me, Keto.~
@1692 = ~You let your envy show, girl. I have found my way, but after all this time, you still can't decide where you fit in.~
@1693 = ~Wh-what?~
@1694 = ~Don't play daft. It is as obvious as one of your tin-plated melodies. You live a life that should make anyone happy, and yet never seem satisfied. And you do nothing to better yourself. You just go where the wind blows you, dissatisfied as the acolyte I once was.~
@1695 = ~I... I don't know what you're talking about.~
@1696 = ~Pah. Of course not.~
@1697 = ~I wish you could see Faenya-Dail, Keto. I've listened to you speak of the exciting places you've been to, but nothing compares, in my eyes.~
@1698 = ~Where is it? I'm always looking for a new place to cool my heels and tell a tale.~ [FWKETOF4]
@1699 = ~It's not someplace you just go. Not without wings.~
@1700 = ~Even I can never go back, but it was so beautiful, Keto. I--I don't remember as much of it as I would like, but to live in the clouds between heaven and earth, it was... oh, I can't even describe it.~
@1701 = ~You're very homesick, aren't you, Aerie?~
@1702 = ~So much I sometimes fear I can't bear it. Uncle Quayle helped me, and when I had more responsibilities in the circus it staved off the pain I feel, but...~
@1703 = ~It feels like I'm always having to leave my home behind. I'm not used to that, the way you are.~
@1704 = ~It's clear that it's hard on you.~
@1705 = ~Didn't you feel as I do, when you first set off on your own?~
@1706 = ~Of sorts... we've very different backgrounds, though.~
@1707 = ~I-I know that. I just thought some things were the same for everyone, like wanting to return to a place you will always remember.~
@1708 = ~Aye... so you'd think.~
@1709 = ~I'm sure Faenya-Dail is beautiful, Aerie, and my thanks for telling me of it. If we can't go, perhaps I'll make a story of it, someday, of the beauty that the earthbound wanderers may never see.~
@1710 = ~That would be wonderful, Keto. Thank you for not thinking me silly.~
@1711 = ~How could I be critical of memories of home, Aerie? You've my thanks for sharing them.~
@1712 = ~Keto, put down that infernal bottle of wine for a moment and come here.~
@1713 = ~Er. Not going to dump it over my head or anything, are you?~ [FWKETOF5]
@1714 = ~Of course not.~
@1715 = ~Now, stand up straight.~
@1716 = ~Uh. Right.~
@1717 = ~Take this. Square your shoulders, and watch your balance.~
@1718 = ~Now, try to hit me with the staff.~
@1719 = ~Anomen, I told you already, I'm really not big on this sparring thing...~
@1720 = ~How else are you going to overcome your ridiculous fear of close combat, Keto?~
@1721 = ~I admit, now, that I erred in thinking you would correct your ways on your own. You have good spirit, though, so I am willing to develop your potential.~
@1722 = ~Come now. Attack!~
@1723 = ~This is humiliating!~
@1724 = ~Nonsense.~
@1725 = ~If you remain unconvinced, then I shall begin.~
@1726 = ~Ow! That hurt!~
@1727 = ~And so it shall, until you defend yourself.~
@1728 = ~Oh, I'll defend myself, all right!~
@1729 = ~Gah!~
@1730 = ~Oh, ah... I didn't mean to aim that low. Really sorry. I'll, ah, just be hiding...~
@1731 = ~Ohhhh...~
@1732 = ~Keto, your problem requires another approach, I think.~
@1733 = ~We're not sparring again, are we? I mean, I thought I did pretty well, but...~ [FWKETOF6]
@1734 = ~One lucky blow hardly qualifies as mastery. Strike that memory in favor of another idea.~
@1735 = ~Answer this question: what do you want from your life?~
@1736 = ~Longevity comes to mind.~
@1737 = ~And? What will you fill your long life with?~
@1738 = ~Good beer, good songs, and good company?~
@1739 = ~Frivolity and leisure are the only aspirations you can muster? You repeatedly strike but one note, Keto.~
@1740 = ~Nonsense! That was at least three notes.~
@1741 = ~Bah. Merely variations of the same irresponsible tune.~
@1742 = ~Anomen, let's talk a moment. I know you don't approve of my lifestyle.~ [FWKETOF7]
@1743 = ~You seem to care little for my approval, Keto. But everyone deserves a chance to live a better life than that of a rootless wanderer.~
@1744 = ~How flattering.~
@1745 = ~I know you don't approve, but, you see, there are leaders and followers in this world, and I'm--~
@1746 = ~Keto. Do you think I cannot see through your flimsy excuses?~
@1747 = ~Er. What do you mean?~
@1748 = ~The Order granted a knighthood, but more than that, it blessed me with an opportunity to face the paths before me and choose a direction.~
@1749 = ~You are very lost, Keto.~
@1750 = ~Save it, Anomen.~
@1751 = ~I will no longer berate your lackadaisical approach to life. I will simply tell you that you will not be happy.~
@1752 = ~You damage yourself to ignore a greater problem. Whether or not your audiences or the few you would call "friend" see through your front or not, I see that your soul is in pain.~
@1753 = ~Leave... leave me be, Anomen. You don't know a thing about me.~
@1754 = ~Do I know less than you?~
@1755 = ~Aerie, I've been curious. What did you do in the circus?~ [FWKETOF8]
@1756 = ~W-when I had my wings, I was an attraction. They paid to see me. In... in a cage.~
@1757 = ~But what about after you were freed?~
@1758 = ~I studied magic and clerical arts under Quayle, but... beyond that, we travelled from one city to another, I watched the acts, helped to clean. We all did a little of everything.~
@1759 = ~Weren't you bored?~
@1760 = ~Bored? Maybe it would seem boring now, but Uncle Quayle always kept me company, and I enjoyed the peace of studying.~
@1761 = ~Ach. I wouldn't have been able to stand it. Then again, I've always been a restless sort.~
@1762 = ~All I really saw of cities was what could be seen from the circus. I'm sure you have many more tales of other places than I do.~
@1763 = ~I wouldn't say that, really; I doubt I saw much more of those same cities. I'm always just passing through.~
@1764 = ~That's all we did as well.~
@1765 = ~I know that what <CHARNAME> does is important, but what I truly want for us to to be able to settle someday. A family, and someone to love, will be wonderful.~
@1766 = ~As exciting as being with <CHARNAME> is I'd love to settle somewhere, though, someday, with a family, and someone to love.~
@1767 = ~Oh, that sounds silly, doesn't it?~
@1768 = ~Hardly. It's something worthy of wishing for. You hear it in songs and stories all the time.~
@1769 = ~A home is important to almost everybody. There are people that spend their whole lives looking for one.~
@1770 = ~That sounds so lonely.~
@1771 = ~Aye, that it is.~
@1772 = ~And I found mine in truly unbelievable fashion, so anything's possible!~
@1773 = ~Er. So I've heard.~
@1774 = ~Keto...?~
@1775 = ~Nothing. Let's get moving before our patient comrades become less so.~
@1776 = ~Your eyes are fine, Aerie. I suggest you be wary of his, however.~ [FWKETOF9]
@1777 = ~Draw you in forever? He'll draw you in, all right.~
@1778 = ~Ah, my robin, playing the role of the stalwart guardian of yonder dove, hmm? A truly sweet sight, but dear Aerie is fully able to respond however she desires.~
@1779 = ~Hmmph! I--~
@1780 = ~Aerie?~
@1781 = ~Aye, he won't laugh at you. Not until *after* he and his bed are done with you.~
@1782 = ~Now my good name is subject to your paranoia, good robin? And after such days we spent as friends--~
@1783 = ~I wouldn't say we've ever been "friends," Haer'Dalis.~
@1784 = ~Yet I recall you being very friendly, regardless. Eager to please, even.~
@1785 = ~But whatever my transgression has been, Keto, I lay all the apologies the planes can offer at your feet.~
@1786 = ~I'm sure you do.~
@1787 = ~My sweet mourning dove, listen not to words of petty anger. Hear me when I say there is no place more befitting of your wonder than upon the stage.~
@1788 = ~That of an elf-hair mattress if you don't watch yourself more carefully, Aerie!~
@1789 = ~What, Keto? I didn't quite hear--~
@1790 = ~Ahem!~
@1791 = ~Haer'Dalis! That's enough! Stop needling her over your idiotic play.~ [FWKETOG0]
@1792 = ~If you find this masterpiece idiotic, Keto, find your way to Sigil and present your learned criticism personally.~
@1793 = ~For one whom I previously held in esteem as an exemplar of talent and charm, your recent antics show a remarkable lack of both. The truth, Keto! I speak only the truth to yon delicate mourning dove, so that the talent may be drawn forth!~
@1794 = ~Hmmph! It's just abuse! If she doesn't like the part, don't force it! What are you trying to do--~
@1795 = ~H-he's trying to help me, Keto. It's all right.~
@1796 = ~Haer'Dalis, maybe... maybe I can try again?~
@1797 = ~Of course, Aerie! I knew you would see the right of things. I trust in full we will not be interrupted again by the envious. Do go on.~
@1798 = ~Oh, it begins, does it?~
@1799 = ~Listen, Haer'Dalis, I'll be crushing more than that here very soon if you don't leave her al--~
@1800 = ~Quiet yourself, damnable crow! I will stand not one more of your shrewish threats! My dove can speak, and you will cease doing it for her!~
@1801 = ~Y-yes, I can still speak, but...~
@1802 = ~The truth? From him? Oh, Aerie, better to ask a leopard to change his spots.~
@1803 = ~If exaggeration for dramatic effect is to be a capital crime, then so be it. "Guilty," say I, and I name you my accomplice, dear robin. Let sentence be carried out forthwith! Let our ashes be scattered and our names forgotten!~
@1804 = ~You know perfectly well what I mean! All those sweet little insinuations of yours aren't worth the spit behind them!~
@1805 = ~My mouth performs only as my heart wills it.~
@1806 = ~And your ever-changing heart would never dream of misleading anyone, now would it?~
@1807 = ~Would you punish a man who said, "Today it rains," when tomorrow it may not?~
@1808 = ~I would if he said "It rains with the power of a million rainclouds, and it will always rain and I will never want for water as long as I live!"~
@1809 = ~Ah, but I would never be caught in such base hyperbole. If you must find blame and deception, turn your spyglass of honesty upon your own heart.~
@1810 = ~Now, my dove, forgive my neglect of your earnest question.~
@1811 = ~I'm telling you, Aerie, please don't give in to him. No good can come of this; he's--he's just using you!~ [FWKETOG1]
@1812 = ~Keto, your accusations and attempts to shield Aerie from the glory of love will not change my heart, and I can but hope it shall not poison hers. True lovers oft endure the catcalls and gainsaying of the jaded.~
@1813 = ~Cease your interfering, crow, 'tis naught to do with you.~
@1814 = ~Oh, yes it is. I know you, Haer'Dalis, and I know how you think! All you want is--~
@1815 = ~Keto! Be... be silent!~
@1816 = ~Y-you heard me! I can speak for myself, and this... this does not involve you.~
@1817 = ~Ah, my mourning dove, you speak so true. Tell me, then, please--does your heart beat for me as mine thrums in my chest for you?~
@1818 = ~Aerie, stop being a daft, foolish child! He won't make your dreams come true, he *won't* take you to a happy ending, he will only take what you give and return nothing but strife. It's all he is! You just don't understand--~
@1819 = ~And you do?~
@1820 = ~He worships destruction, of all things! He revels in taking something beautiful and making it into something spent and hollow--and you're his latest victim!~
@1821 = ~Is there to be no end? Have we not patiently endured this brittle chorus long enough?~
@1822 = ~Leave this magpie to her jealousy over what we enjoy today. Tell me, Aerie, who should know me best? Yon graceful creature I have loved ardently and indulged at length so many happy evenings... or a crow overcome with her consuming envy for you, hell-bent on depriving you your budding happiness?~
@1823 = ~I--I...~
@1824 = ~I love you, Haer'Dalis, and there is nothing, and no one, that will change my mind.~
@1825 = ~Hear me now, my robin. Entropy has passed o'er us, and its wake has inevitably brought rise to greatness.~
@1826 = ~Aerie is now more than she e'er has been, awakened from her innocence, and your friendship is no more.~
@1827 = ~There is nothing left for us to fight about, now, and we may forget hasty words and quick tempers. Many a great work could still come about were our talent paired, I think.~
@1828 = ~...Are you completely mad?~ [FWKETOG2]
@1829 = ~Perhaps you do not see this change as rich in potential as I? T'would be a pity to let our opportunity go to waste, but not all can be so receptive to the beauty chaos rends.~
@1830 = ~Haer'Dalis... the only opportunity I want right now is one to send your cold, desiccated corpse into the maw of the Oblivion you never stop talking about.~
@1831 = ~Still a touch sensitive, I see.~
@1832 = ~Keldorn. A moment, please?~ [FWKETOG3]
@1833 = ~What is it, Keto? We have much to do, and time is of the essence. Little time remains for dallying.~
@1834 = ~I know. This is important, though, I believe.~
@1835 = ~I am pleased to see you focused and sober, at least. Go on.~
@1836 = ~It's a story, and I hope you'll hear it to the end. Of the origin of bards, at least from my perspective. And, really, as I'm the one walking this path, my perspective is the most important.~
@1837 = ~I want to assist you, but I am not sure I see how--~
@1838 = ~Hear me out.~
@1839 = ~Very well, tell your tale.~
@1840 = ~Ages ago--the exact time is forgotten, as is the location, and many of the names--two brothers lived in a small village. One brother, known now only as Savion, was strong and healthy, of good heart and wise mind. He was well-known and well-loved, and he would fight to the death to protect hearth and home.~
@1841 = ~His brother was of slight stature and fragile health. He was bright, but oft-misunderstood, and decidedly imperfect. He was given to look to the local girls more than to his chores, and to neglect the morning hours, slumbering deeply and well into the afternoon. He tended to eat a little more than his share, and to dominate the conversation when he could.~
@1842 = ~However, for all that could be said against him, he meant well. And, truer than anything else about his character, he admired Savion. Perhaps envied him at times, but black emotions did not fester in his heart against his brother. They held a unity in bond and spirit, one not easily broken.~
@1843 = ~It came to pass that the threat of a dragon loomed over the village, and fear took hold in the souls of the people. They saw the beast, distant in the skies, and learned that he was feeding upon the horses and cattle that roamed the plains. In despair, they waited as it came ever closer, terrified to awaken in the night to find their homes, family, and lives in ashes.~
@1844 = ~Savion could not bear this for long. He bade the blacksmith forge him sword and armor, and even with no combat experience, he prepared to go to battle. His courage inspired the people of the village, and they sent him off as already a hero. But he did not go alone.~
@1845 = ~Against Savion's wishes, his brother followed after him. Too weak to wield a sword, unfamiliar with magics either arcane or divine, and barely able to keep stride, he followed--adamant on being at his brother's side.~
@1846 = ~The dragon came upon them by surprise, swooping in on them from the sky. With one hit from a giant claw, he sent them both to the ground. Savion's armor spared him serious injury, but his brother was gravely wounded. Running was impossible now.~
@1847 = ~Savion stood to face the legendary monster, now determined to take it to its death to protect his family--his brother--from further harm.~
@1848 = ~Injured and helpless, the brother could only watch as Savion hurled himself into the fray, suffering blow after blow, doing so little with his sword. The dragon paused for a moment, recoiled and prepared to unleash the fire that would destroy the brothers--and Savion looked back.~
@1849 = ~He actually smiled, for a flash of an instant, and mouthed to his brother one word--"Live." With a leap and howl unleashed from the depths of his being, Savion hurled himself into the dragon's maw, and it choked on its own flames.~
@1850 = ~The beast and Savion were both dead, but, as Savion willed him to do, his brother survived. The bond between brothers had not broken. Yet, he returned to the village a changed man.~
@1851 = ~The village mourned the loss of Savion, but only for a time. The dragon was dead, so quickly enough it was back to business as usual. His name began to be forgotten, and the brother was angered by it. For the rest of his days, he told the tale of Savion and the dragon, and how one man's unselfish sacrifice saved not only his remaining family, but an entire village that swiftly forgot his name.~
@1852 = ~To his children, he passed on the tale, and gave to his brother a legacy. Perhaps he felt responsible, and felt that by immortalizing Savion, he could assuage his guilt. Perhaps he merely wanted a way to pass the time and to earn his own sort of fame.~
@1853 = ~Or, as I believe, he wanted to ensure they--the people Savion died to save--would remember. To ensure that the past would be cherished, and that belief in heroes would not fade.~
@1854 = ~*This* is why we tell the tales, Keldorn. We tell them to remind ourselves, and to remind others, of what has come before. To ensure the world doesn't take itself too seriously, and to prevent great evil from coming again. To give hope to those who otherwise would have none. To remember that which would otherwise be forgotten.~
@1855 = ~To the brother, his own name was unimportant. What was important was that the first hero rose up and battled what was thought an invincible foe. What was important was that he fought and died for no other reason than to protect what he loved.~
@1856 = ~You sound so sincere, Keto, that I know you believe what you say. I almost believe you myself.~
@1857 = ~Yet I have heard far too many tales grounded in falsehoods, too many songs written for no other reason than to advance the status of the teller or her subject. Those are not the fruits of a commendable calling.~
@1858 = ~But this is what my calling is to me, Keldorn. And as this is my life, what I see and feel and know of it is more important to me than what some foppish minstrel believes while he's strumming his harp in an inn!~
@1859 = ~To forget and to be forgotten is *awful*, Keldorn! A story or ballad may not always be the full truth, but at the least it's *there*, and not just lost as though it never occurred!~
@1860 = ~Calm yourself, Keto!~
@1861 = ~I'm not certain I believe in the dogma you follow, but you do mean what you say in earnest.~
@1862 = ~Youth gives you idealism; that is one of its greater gifts. If more of your ilk believed as you do, then there would be less call to question the motives of storytellers, minstrels, and true masters of the bardic arts such as yourself.~
@1863 = ~I--~
@1864 = ~I have not finished. That you shared this with me tells me more than any story ever could. There is reason fueling your existence after all. With that foundation, time and maturity will help keep you on the right path.~
@1865 = ~Thank you, Keldorn. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me.~
@1866 = ~You have seldom given me cause to praise you, Keto. And you still must learn to let go of your addictions. They only hinder you, in whatever you may choose.~
@1867 = ~If you truly seek to be the memory of all that the world threatens to forget, you need all your wits about you, at every moment.~
@1868 = ~You do not often invite praise, Keto. But you have shown me that you are willing to let go of your addictions. Perhaps you have come to realize that to be the memory of all that the world threatens to forget, you need all your wits about you, at every moment.~
@1869 = ~But remember this also, as the word of experience--some things are best left forgotten. Not all things in this world should be unearthed. You may not be ready for what you uncover, and the world may not always welcome your reminder.~

@2000 = ~Can't get a drink to save me life.~
@2001 = ~Watch yer step. Floor's slick with ale.~
@2002 = ~Friends! I've a tale, if you've the will to hear it!~ [FWKETO48]
@2003 = ~I've a will!~
@2004 = ~And you, sir?~
@2005 = ~I've a will and a coin if the story's any good.~
@2006 = ~A fair offer! Listen well!~
@2007 = ~Many centuries ago lived a small brood of powerful planewalkers. It is said that they could go almost anywhere and do almost anything they willed. They would never grow old, could drink or eat as they pleased--~
@2008 = ~I like 'em already!~
@2009 = ~--and escape almost any death you could contrive for them.~
@2010 = ~These planewalkers were crafty and amoral, proud and quarrelsome. They loved little more than to fight amongst themselves, but killing their own kind was unheard of. For each had the power to pronounce a terrible curse in times of mortal peril, and none wanted to earn such a black stain from a brother or sister.~
@2011 = ~Two of the brothers, Orwain and Aric, fought the fiercest because each felt he was the strongest, the best, the most fit to lead. When it came that their father died, Aric moved quickly to seize power, becoming liege of their ancestral home.~
@2012 = ~When Orwain learned of this, he was furious. He walked the planes and proclaimed himself a god in order to raise a terrible army. He took this army and marched on his home, intent on unseating his brother and establishing, once and for all, who was the better man.~
@2013 = ~But he was not the only one. In his millennia, their father had made many enemies, and they raised fierce platoons of demons and devils and terrible fiends to avenge their losses.~
@2014 = ~I thought devils and demons hated each other?~
@2015 = ~Quiet!~
@2016 = ~But I heard--~
@2017 = ~Shut it! She's just getting to the good part!~
@2018 = ~So Orwain's armies were unopposed as they marched to the valley at the foot of the castle, and he was prepared for any trap. Instead, he saw his brother's troops locked in deadly combat with the hellspawn invaders. He did not hesitate to protect his home, and set his men to slay the demons.~
@2019 = ~His men turned the tide, and the creatures were routed. Orwain himself slew over one hundred of the creatures. Slick with their black blood but still strong, he sought his brother on the battlefield, hoping to settle the score that he had come for.~
@2020 = ~But Aric lay dying of dozens of wounds, his legendary fortitude not enough to save him. Orwain cast aside his sword and fell to one knee at his brother's side, fully expecting to hear his dying rival speak the damning words.~
@2021 = ~Would serve him right, the bugger.~
@2022 = ~Not another word!~
@2023 = ~And Aric cursed him all right--told him he was a bastard, a fornicator, and a few other choice words betwixt bloody coughing fits. But he saved the power of his dying breath for the true enemies of the realm, the ones who came to destroy, not to rule. The demon armies were harassed by divine winds all the way back to the hells from where they came.~
@2024 = ~Orwain gained a kingdom but lost a brother. Some say it was the only way their relationship could end. Others say 'twas a shame the two could never learn to cooperate, until it was too late. But everyone knew that the day could not have been won without the two coming together to save their home.~
@2025 = ~What happened then? How did Orwain's rule fare?~
@2026 = ~Did the demons ever return?~
@2027 = ~And what of the other siblings? Did they stand for all this?~
@2028 = ~Boys, boys... that's another story!~
@2029 = ~<CHARNAME>... I've been holding my tongue--didn't want to be a distraction--but you act like meeting a forgotten god is all in a day's work for you.~ [FWKETO49]
@2030 = ~That is because it is. I have met many creatures that would stop you dead in your tracks, Keto. You get used to such things after a while.~
@2031 = ~You didn't see me cry? The whole thing was just so sad, I could not help myself.~
@2032 = ~I just act that way. It makes things easier. In reality, I am still surprised I wake up outside of my room back in Candlekeep.~
@2033 = ~I know we are of an age, Keto, but I have seen many things that you have only heard of in tale and song. The avatar? Impressive, but hardly anything to lose my head over.~
@2034 = ~As soon as he handed *me* that all-powerful artifact, I knew he could not possibly be *that* omniscient and wise. That reduced the awe factor.~
@2035 = ~Keto, I would take tea with every god past, present, and future without even a trace of amazement if it would just get me away from your endless babbling. That, bard, would be the truly astonishing occurrence.~
@2036 = ~I do? I was just doing what I was told so nothing tried to eat me.~
@2037 = ~No, I... I suppose I didn't. Huh. And here I was thinking I was the only one who saw the sheer hopeless majesty of the whole thing.~
@2038 = ~Amaunator and his servants, stuck in that unlife... I'm glad we broke the spell. Even if it looks like that's really the end for the old god.~
@2039 = ~I know. Please stop. I don't want to cry again.~
@2040 = ~If I don't concentrate too hard, I can pretend this whole thing is just an elaborate dream. It helps, some.~
@2041 = ~I am quite certain it will not be the most majestic sight we will ever see together.~
@2042 = ~Really? I suppose familiarity breeds contempt, but I'm not sure I could ever see so much that these things become... commonplace!~
@2043 = ~Stick with me a little longer, then.~
@2044 = ~You are young yet, Keto. Things are still new to you. Give it time.~
@2045 = ~I used to think that, as well. It is amazing how much things change.~
@2046 = ~I lied. Scared me silly. But I have to keep up appearances, lest you start doubting me.~
@2047 = ~That makes a little more sense. I'm amazed you can stand it.~
@2048 = ~So am I, sometimes. But I manage. I do not really get much of a choice in the matter.~
@2049 = ~I am not sure I really do. I worry that all I am really doing is going along in whatever direction I get shoved in. It is not a pleasant feeling.~
@2050 = ~It is not so bad. Provided I don't think about all the places I would rather be and all the things I would rather be doing.~
@2051 = ~It's not like I've only seen kobolds and wolves in my travels, <CHARNAME>. I just don't understand how you can find so little wonder in... well, anything.~
@2052 = ~Familiarity breeds contempt, Keto. You will come to see that in time.~
@2053 = ~What's wondrous about a dying god? It has happened before, it will happen again. He can do little for me now anyway.~
@2054 = ~I wish I could still find some things incredible. It gets harder as time goes on, though.~
@2055 = ~Shhh! I am trying to fake my way through this and you are ruining it!~
@2056 = ~Heh! I admit, it's a little strange, but I guess we're better than no one, which is exactly who he'd have without us. Still, isn't it a little inspiring?~
@2057 = ~You're the bard, Keto. You're the one that's supposed to get inspired. I just do the work and give you something to talk about.~
@2058 = ~I suppose. I have learned, though, that if I take it too seriously, I simply walk around saying "Wow! Wow! Wow!" a lot, and what kind of leader does that make?~
@2059 = ~Think that's inspiring? Stick with me, kid, you won't believe what you'll see.~
@2060 = ~Not especially. Seeing amazing things comes with the territory. It is what adventurers do, after all.~
@2061 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't know how I've managed to offend you, but obviously I have. Or are you this much of a bastard to everyone? Forget it, let's finish this and get out of here--in silence, as you wish.~
@2062 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't know how I've managed to offend you, but obviously I have. Or are you this much of a bitch to everyone? Forget it, let's finish this and get out of here--in silence, as you wish.~
@2063 = ~Heh! True enough, true enough. I just thought that for something I can hardly believe, you're acting incredibly uninspired over it. Stands to reason that you've just been keeping quiet and following orders, though.~
@2064 = ~You betcha. Forgotten gods give me the willies. But, still, such is the life of the adventurer.~
@2065 = ~I suppose. It'll be an interesting trip, to say the least. Sometimes I'm shocked to realize I'm here, though.~
@2066 = ~It wasn't so long ago my biggest concern was a hole in my boot or a rainstorm mussing up travel.~
@2067 = ~Ahh, but the simple worries are just that, now, aren't they? Just as well. Let's see where this takes us, then. This journey grows more epic yet!~
@2068 = ~Heh, if you say so, <CHARNAME>, if you say so. I will do my best to be suitably inspired in our travels and spread your name in every tale I tell, and you can remain stalwart even in the face of gods. Aye, even trade, that one!~
@2069 = ~Good point. We'd never get anywhere if we tripped over ourselves every time something unusual happened.~
@2070 = ~All right, <CHARNAME>, I've got my jaw off the floor, now. Lead on, then, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!~
@2071 = ~Don't be dismayed, <CHARNAME>.~
@2072 = ~I... know your heritage hasn't made things easy on you. I know it must've thrust this life upon you, no matter what you'd prefer.~
@2073 = ~You've good company around you; there isn't a chance you'll be facing this all alone. We can find courage amongst ourselves, aye? I would never even have made it down here without you.~
@2074 = ~And, in some cases, I would've been happier that way, heh. But you've seen us through so far, and I trust you'll see us through the rest.~
@2075 = ~I trust you. Let's get moving, then, shall we?~
@2076 = ~I can hardly believe... we've come out of a dragon's lair, a *red* no less, and our skins are intact... I can scarcely believe it!~ [FWKETOL0]
@2077 = ~<CHARNAME>, I don't know if... I can't think of... I'm not sure I...~ [FWKETOL1]
@2078 = ~... I'm really not sure what to say!~ [FWKETOL2]
@2079 = ~Neither am I. That was a little disconcerting, to say the least.~
@2080 = ~Yes, but he only let us go because we haven't finished entertaining him. I can't say I like that at all.~
@2081 = ~Bastard dragon! I cannot BELIEVE he is just treating us like pawns in his obscene little game! I will rip the scales from his hide when I get the chance!~
@2082 = ~I shall not suffer that creature to live for long, Keto. We will be back. There are just more important matters to attend to right now.~
@2083 = ~I am surprised we got out of there alive, myself. Let him have his games. I would rather not face that thing again.~
@2084 = ~There's a first time for everything.~
@2085 = ~P'feh, no joke. So what are you going to do now?~
@2086 = ~You had to ask that didn't you? I suppose just move on. I would rather not face him again, if I can help it.~
@2087 = ~Skin him of his scales when I get a chance. We can't risk it now, but we will. Mark my words...~
@2088 = ~There are more important things to look into for now, but we may come back and deal with that creature. I am not his pawn, and I intend to prove it.~
@2089 = ~We keep going, like we always have. I will not abandon my responsibilities because he holds such a high opinion of himself.~
@2090 = ~Hiding comes to mind. Staying away from *him*, at any rate.~
@2091 = ~Who would, <CHARNAME>? This is a lousy situation, no doubt. But what can we do?~
@2092 = ~Drive a pike straight through his neck when we get a chance, that's what we can do. As much as I hate waiting, though, it must.~
@2093 = ~Get back to what we should be worrying about instead of some dragon's power games. When the time comes, he will be no match for me.~
@2094 = ~Calm down, <CHARNAME>! Losing your temper won't help anything. Hell, if anything, he's enjoying it.~
@2095 = ~I can't stand being taunted like that! Acting like WE are at his mercy?!? He will be at MINE soon enough, I swear it!~
@2096 = ~I know you are right, Keto, but dammit, I can't stand being his...his... entertainment!~
@2097 = ~Oh, get off it, Keto. A little fury would do you good. Isn't this the action and adventure you said you were looking for?~
@2098 = ~You plan to destroy him? I... mmmph.~
@2099 = ~'Twould be an incredible feat, and definitely a mark for all that is good and right, aye, but could you defeat him?~
@2100 = ~He's never met a foe quite like me, Keto. When the time comes, I will prevail.~
@2101 = ~I am not sure, but I will not be satisfied until one of us is dead.~
@2102 = ~With such a strong company behind me? How could I not?~
@2103 = ~Probably not. (sigh) Not now, in any case. I will be strong enough to do it someday, though. I swear it.~
@2104 = ~Good thinking. I'm none too eager to deal with him again myself.~
@2105 = ~I am surprised. Wouldn't you prefer having some grand story to tell about a dragon's downfall?~
@2106 = ~I hope I am not disappointing you. I know what happened here was not exactly the stuff of legends.~
@2107 = ~What a surprise. No wonder your story collection consists mostly of running away. It embarrasses me to be following suit.~
@2108 = ~I am glad you are still willing to travel with me, at least, after hearing him talk about what I--~
@2109 = ~A wee bit touchy thanks to the whole affair, aye? All right, <CHARNAME>, I won't bring it up again.~
@2110 = ~Very wise of you. Aye, let him stew in his own self-importance! There are grander things for us to do!~
@2111 = ~Thanks for the support, Keto. Now would you mind not doing that quite so loudly?~
@2112 = ~Indeed! A tale of rescue and valiance in the face of danger is what it shall be, and there will be none to call us cowards for it.~
@2113 = ~Less suicidal things for us to do, at any rate. I feel wretched having been through all that just for his amusement, though.~
@2114 = ~Yes, many things. And if he wants to watch my efforts, so be it. But, Keto, you heard him say what I am. Don't you--~
@2115 = ~That's quite the oath, <CHARNAME>. Are you sure you can live up to it? And live after it, for that matter.~
@2116 = ~Absolutely! I have no doubts about my strength. His scales will decorate my back before long. But now, he would expect it. Soon.~
@2117 = ~The world's greatest story is worthless when the teller dies with it.~
@2118 = ~The crowd will be content with a tale of a bold thrust into the lair of an ancient, powerful beast, slaying the monstrosities within, and then bargaining with the dragon himself for the life of his captive! It'll stir the heart and earn me a beer, have no worry.~
@2119 = ~Lovely, Keto, but we did not really bargain--~
@2120 = ~I like the story already. Remember to make me 8 feet tall.~
@2121 = ~I am never going to understand bards. Let's go.~
@2122 = ~I am not nearly as concerned about that as I am about what Firkraag had to say about me. It is not something I want to get around--~
@2123 = ~As you like! Aye, it's a tale that'll please the crowd well enough, and they'll remember us both!~
@2124 = ~A very bold promise. Sounds like you want to write the next chapter of your tale already.~
@2125 = ~When and if you decide to face Firkraag, <CHARNAME>, I'll be there with you. I know you well enough to know you're not the sort to make these decisions rashly.~
@2126 = ~If you say so, <CHARNAME>. I just hope you come to your senses before then.~
@2127 = ~That's a difficult way to live. I know you're angry for what he's done, but it's rare that actions based on revenge ever come to anything fruitful.~
@2128 = ~I could be wrong. Just glad you're thinking before you act, though.~
@2129 = ~I'll just pick up my jaw and then we can get moving. There are other things I would speak to you of, but not right now.~
@2130 = ~Heh! Good to know you remember you won't be in this alone, <CHARNAME>. Aye, you'll have my help for certain; let's hope that will be enough, if and when you face him.~
@2131 = ~I may be your ally, <CHARNAME>, but I'm not willing to die for the sake of your pride. You may come to your senses, though, so I'll bear you no grudge.~
@2132 = ~Here's to hoping, then. We'll have to see how things go from here on out.~
@2133 = ~Don't be dismayed, <CHARNAME>. I know you're meant for great things. So does everyone else, including that dragon. It's why he let us go.~
@2134 = ~Heh, sorry. Aye, I'm just glad you're looking at things in perspective, <CHARNAME>.~
@2135 = ~As you'd like! Aye, it's a tale that'll please the crowd well enough, and earn me a beer, no less.~
@2136 = ~Completely understandable, <CHARNAME>. I'm not feeling my best either, really. Though I know you have bigger concerns.~
@2137 = ~Hush, now, you. We'll... we'll talk about that later. I'm still getting my thoughts together on it. Let's just recover and get moving, aye?~
@2138 = ~I have a feeling it doesn't matter if we come back tomorrow or in fifteen years, <CHARNAME>. He'll be expecting us.~
@2139 = ~Ah, but I shouldn't be so discouraging. Let's recover from the whole ordeal, and then continue our ventures far and away from here...~
@2140 = ~Aye, I know well enough, but the crowd certainly doesn't! No stifling of the creative spirit, now, heh.~
@2141 = ~Ye gods... I'm almost in shock; I can't believe we... <CHARNAME>, do you realize what we've *done*?~ [FWKETOL3]
@2142 = ~Killed a creature of great evil and power, freeing the Windspear Hills of his menace. Yes, I realize precisely what we have done.~
@2143 = ~Yeah, killed Firkraag, a really damn old dragon. Not bad for a day's work. You're ready to amplify my already substantial legend now, right?~
@2144 = ~If I stop and think about what we've done, I may drop dead from amazement. We aren't dead. Can you believe it?~
@2145 = ~Torn the filthy scales from his back and sent his spirit straight into the Hells where it belongs. Of course I know what we did.~
@2146 = ~We have done very well. Better than I thought we would, actually.~
@2147 = ~Taken revenge for his treating me like his toy to run through his gauntlet at mere whim. It feels good.~
@2148 = ~Destroyed a beast of myth and legend, Keto! Isn't this all the adventure you could have hoped for? Won't the audience be thrilled?~
@2149 = ~Do you know how *old* he must have been? How much power he commanded? I thought the battle would never end! I couldn't believe it when you challenged him! And at the end, we... we...~
@2150 = ~We won, Keto. And we made it out alive and mostly intact.~
@2151 = ~We put an end to a foul scourge.~
@2152 = ~"We"? I did it, Keto. My strategy, my plan, my will. I have slain the dragon.~
@2153 = ~Aye, is that how it was? I think my tale will be a more balanced one. Your accomplishment can't be denied, but you don't stand alone, <CHARNAME>. Whether you like it or not.~
@2154 = ~Aye! Indeed! Though I don't know if anyone will believe it... I scarcely believe it myself! What do I even say to you now, <CHARNAME>?~
@2155 = ~"Good job" might not be a bad place to start.~
@2156 = ~Say nothing, please. Just shut up.~
@2157 = ~Just say that you will be glad to remain part of the group, Keto. I owe a lot of my success to you.~
@2158 = ~Tell me you are glad to be alive and want to buy me a drink.~
@2159 = ~Don't worry about what to say to me! Worry about what to say to the story-starved public! There won't be a naysayer in sight for you, now. And if there are... heh, just tell them they can come speak to ME.~
@2160 = ~No need to say anything, Keto. We did what we needed to do, and that is all there is to it. We cannot rest on our laurels just yet, though. there is still work to be done.~
@2161 = ~Such words of bravery and self-assurance, never before fallen so eloquently from a hero's lips! Kidding aside, though, <CHARNAME>, I can't say I'm sure of what to say to you.~
@2162 = ~Such a simple request at such a grand moment.~
@2163 = ~Hardly even enough words to convey what you've accomplished, but here it is: damn good job, <CHARNAME>. While a little worrisome at times, it's certainly a privilege to be in your company.~
@2164 = ~Well, congratulations, then, <CHARNAME>. Hope you realize that this is an accomplishment to be remembered, and not just another fallen being at your feet.~
@2165 = ~You seem to accept my help readily enough, but not my congratulations? Fine, have it your way. You don't prove yourself worthy of talking to very often anyhow.~
@2166 = ~Heh! And now resorting to flattering me, <CHARNAME>? No need, I'd help you regardless. I worry about you sometimes, with all the danger you put us in... but you bring us out of it, don't you?~
@2167 = ~Glad we're alive, <CHARNAME>, and, aye, it's a free round for everyone at our next stop. Because as much as I appreciate my company, they aren't getting into my personal stash, heh.~
@2168 = ~You're too kind to me, truly. Every alehouse we see will hear about this, trust me.~
@2169 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad I came along with you, and I'm glad you'll let me tell the tale.~
@2170 = ~You worry me sometimes, but there's never a dull moment!~
@2171 = ~Aye, true enough. Let's attend to what is yet to be done, then.~
@2172 = ~There will be time for celebration later on! And, even if there isn't, you can count on me to make it.~
@2173 = ~Yoshimo...? Yoshimo, this has to be a mistake. It has to be! Tell <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@2174 = ~Wait... I know him! Hey, you! Leave him alone! He doesn't owe you a thing!~
@2175 = ~No trouble, Lanfar. Flash around too much coin, again? You know that just makes you a target...~
@2176 = ~I know, I know. Sometimes I wonder how I ever stay in business. Thanks for helping me, again, Miss Riven.~
@2177 = ~Glad to help. Just watch yourself, aye?~
@2178 = ~Lucky for you that she came along. That man did not seem interested in talk.~
@2179 = ~Aye, Lanfar seems to run into those sorts a lot. This is the third time I've had to bail him out this month! Are you going to be more careful, now?~
@2180 = ~Of course. Now, there must be something I can do to repay you...~
@2181 = ~I, for one, certainly feel reassured! If we're fast, there's a chance we might not meet a grisly end! Who else feels confident? Anyone?~
@2182 = ~None of that, Keto. We're here on a mission to eradicate this blasphemy, and 'tis only fitting that we should be the ones to face the danger.~
@2183 = ~I'm more for letting someone else clean out these things. Besides, just look down there, will you? It reeks!~
@2184 = ~So do all pits of corruption and foulness. Bring up your courage, Keto, if you have any, and stop dawdling. This creature must be stopped, and this our only opportunity to see to it.~
@2185 = ~He's right, child. This cult poses a greater danger to us, and to the balance, than I think you realize. This desecration must end.~
@2186 = ~Aye, I know, I know, I just... well, I don't have to like it, do I? All right, let's get this over and done with--with luck, I can hold my breath that long. Wish us luck, Tad! We'll need it!~
@2187 = ~You know, Jan, right up there with "never try to drink a dwarf under the table," I advise "don't invite the wrath of gods upon your head." But, for the record, the answer is: A *lot* of ale.~
@2188 = ~This is one of the forgotten gods, then? Here for so long, and undiscovered? Guarding this... object that the Unseeing Eye wants so much? How could all of this have been under Athkatla for so long, and no one realize it?~
@2189 = ~My head hurts...~
@2190 = ~So... we're to see a god fade away, then, completely? Because of what we've accomplished? Is anyone even going to believe this? Aye, the story of watching Amaunator shoot off into the heavens, they'll believe THAT one.~
@2191 = ~This is all very depressing. Reborn into a circle of neverending, pointless death?~
@2192 = ~You would be amazed to know what the gods will put their servants through to serve their purposes. No matter how base, some power will be enriched by the suffering.~
@2193 = ~It's things like this that made me stay out of any kind of clergy. Well, that and the fact that most faiths would lock the doors when they saw me coming, heh.~
@2194 = ~<CHARNAME>, we'd best be moving before the bard's delay ends with a rag stuffed in her mouth. Let us get this object and then out of this place.~
@2195 = ~Mmmph. Maybe that thing in the temple is hate given form, or some such thing. These--folk--are certainly sending enough negativity that way to shape such a creature.~
@2196 = ~How do we get past something that's pure hatred?~
@2197 = ~And that's what they always say about civilizing ghouls--utterly futile. Uh, hey, <CHARNAME>, I think he's serious!~
@2198 = ~"Mayor"? Did I really just hear there's a mayor for these things?~
@2199 = ~An abomination if there is such a thing! Monsters, playing at civilization!~
@2200 = ~Indeed. We should all tread carefully, here. There is something most foul at work.~
@2201 = ~Could just be the dead bodies scattered around, too, you know. Have I mentioned that I really don't like it down here?~
@2202 = ~Many times, Keto. I would pray for anyone that *did* enjoy themselves here. But we must not be fearful in the face of adversity. Great corruption dwells here, and it is our place to cleanse it.~
@2203 = ~About the only thing I really feel like cleansing is myself, Keldorn. This stench will never be out of my clothes...~
@2204 = ~This just keeps getting stranger by the minute. What's going on down here?~
@2205 = ~Well, I think we're going to find out. But I have to agree with you that this is... very...~
@2206 = ~Approaching all new levels of wrong, if you ask me.~
@2207 = ~Something like that, yes.~
@2208 = ~While I don't deny that the cult we saw out there is a little disturbing, I also don't see how it means we're ordained to trot off into the sewers and find out what it's all about.~
@2209 = ~Oooh! But I can see it now... "Ladies and gentlemen, this story is brought to you out of the depths of the sewers, from the heart of an eyeless cult! Oh, what festers beneath the streets of Athkatla..."~
@2210 = ~Sounds like a fine fellow! Yet another force of righteousness to heckle me. Oh, joyous day!~
@2211 = ~The only thing that intrigues me less than stomping about in the sewers is doing so for the Talassans...~
@2212 = ~You know, if I ever get quite that far gone, I'd appreciate someone tossing me into the sea.~
@2213 = ~That bein' the case, drink up!~
@2214 = ~If I didn't hear it myself, I would scarcely believe it. You, Keto, professing limits? Hmmph. Amazing.~
@2215 = ~Keep drinking until it either fixes itself or you can't see at all. In either case, you won't have a worry at all until you wake up!~
@2216 = ~No thanks. Sailing makes me squeamish, and the fish don't make a good audience, besides.~
@2217 = ~Oh, Haer'Dalis, why don't you go on ahead with him? I'd be happy to see you off!~
@2218 = ~P'feh, you're ignoring me.~
@2219 = ~Ah, well, you could always... rent one, maybe?~
@2220 = ~It's not that I have any objection to robbing a Talassan priest, but I'm not sure we can get away with it, <CHARNAME>. I know we do what we have to do, but thievery doesn't make a good tale if all that's left of you is smoldering boots.~
@2221 = ~Need I say that I think this is a bad idea, <CHARNAME>? Picking a pocket, well, that's one thing... taking some things out of someone's home, that's worse... but robbing a temple? I don't know about this, <CHARNAME>.~
@2222 = ~Apparently, being a Shadow Thief means jabbing sharp objects into whoever upsets you.~
@2223 = ~Just love the variety of friendly people around here.~
@2224 = ~You're right, aye, it is! Here, have a sip of this, it'll warm up the blood for you.~
@2225 = ~A tale of high adventure and stealth to make even the most indifferent listener call for the guard, to be sure.~
@2226 = ~So you're here to stand around and look threatening, then? Aye, a wonder that is.~
@2227 = ~Heh, if it makes you feel better. Ask them to change the sign on the door, if it bothers you so.~
@2228 = ~Nothing like preemptive threats to make MY day, what about you, <CHARNAME>?~
@2229 = ~Of course not. No one wants to fight a war on two fronts.~
@2230 = ~I'm not exactly enthused to be playing the part of a petty thief, <CHARNAME>, but I suppose it's the means to an end. I know you need to garner as much influence as you can to rescue your friend, but I'd think there are better ways of going about it.~
@2231 = ~I-I don't like this either. But I trust <CHARNAME> to make things work out for the best.~
@2232 = ~Must the two of you simper like children at every choice <CHARNAME> makes? I tire of listening to you. If you do not wish to follow <PRO_HISHER> instructions, leave.~
@2233 = ~It'll be all right, Aerie. Nothing'll happen that we can't handle.~
@2234 = ~It seems he's dead regardless of what we do. A good riddance, I think, but why trouble ourselves with it?~
@2235 = ~Indeed. I, myself, am well weary of doing the bidding of thieves. Leave them to their petty squabbling, <CHARNAME>.~
@2236 = ~If this is what you want, <CHARNAME>. Just don't get too crazy with it, aye?~
@2237 = ~Ach. I think perhaps you need a new hobby.~
@2238 = ~I'm detecting a little hostility around here, <CHARNAME>.~
@2239 = ~P'feh. Not exactly smelling like a bed of roses yourself, sunshine.~
@2240 = ~"Johnny, you're a dumb one,
does you think that I were blind?
If you hadn't given reason
I'd never spanked your sore behind!"~
@2241 = ~Aw, missy, that were me line tha' ye jest took!~
@2242 = ~Oops! Sorry, carry on.~
@2243 = ~Salrigh'. Ye did it wrong anyway! Goes like this...~
@2244 = ~Wouldn't that be a wonder? Have you checked the bottom of your ale mug?~
@2245 = ~Oh, yer a smart one, ye is.~
@2246 = ~Ah, aye, I'm sure that's what they are... (snort)~
@2247 = ~Aye, good entertainment is so hard to find, isn't it?~
@2248 = ~Speak for yourself, my robin. I, myself, have had the exquisite honor of being surrounded by talent both humbling and inspiring, lifting me to all new heights of glamour so that I might touch the planes once more.~
@2249 = ~Entertainment is simple to find. It's the true mystical talent that proves ever elusive.~
@2250 = ~Must you annoy me at every opportunity?~
@2251 = ~I speak merely as the spirit wills!~
@2252 = ~Oh, Anomen, this is horrible... I'm sorry for you. I wish I knew what advice to give.~
@2253 = ~This is madness! Anomen, pull yourself together--please!~
@2254 = ~Silence, you empty-headed fool! I can destroy you just as easily!~
@2255 = ~I can't believe everyone here is blaming him for what he didn't even know!~
@2256 = ~He should 'ave been here! He should 'ave looked after all this, and he wasn't here!~
@2257 = ~How could he know? You're just looking for somebody to blame! That's not at all fair! You... you cold-hearted witch!~
@2258 = ~That is enough, Keto. Come, <CHARNAME>, let us step outside and speak a moment.~
@2259 = ~You know, Edwin, I seem to remember something about that scroll, now that you mention transformation. I can't recall everything, but I don't think--~
@2260 = ~(Bah! Infernal bard interrupts my ascension to greatness!) Yes, you are quite right, bard, you don't think anything at all. Now silence yourself, and you may be spared the wrath of my impending might.~
@2261 = ~You look horrible. Um... do you want me to help you carry anything, Jaheira?~
@2262 = ~Do you always say what comes first to your mind? (cough) But... no... I need no help. I will remain strong enough to wring Ployer's neck, I assure you.~
@2263 = ~And it reeks, too. What's down here?~
@2264 = ~Well, if I'm not a damned idiot, it looks to me like that be a tomb, with all sorts o' undead creepy crawlies waiting fer an axe in their skulls--what, girlie, scared?~
@2265 = ~Er. No, no, not at all.~
@2266 = ~Good. Means I won't be listening to yer whining any more, aye?~
@2267 = ~I know it's a little much to hope for that there is always an antidote to negate a poison... but it always works out that way in stories! Oh, it has to work...~
@2268 = ~What is it, Nalia? Don't tell us things have gotten even worse for you.~
@2269 = ~Bread and cheese? Oh, how bland. Some wine and a good steak will get you further.~
@2270 = ~That also costs quite a bit, miss. It's bread and cheese for those of us that can't pay that much for a full meal.~
@2271 = ~"Pay"? Oh, ah, right, of course. Such a pity.~
@2272 = ~Slaving bastards! You can't treat people like that--and you won't, ever again!~
@2273 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>, I would've hated to think of her out and alone without so much as a copper.~
@2274 = ~<PRO_HESHE> always knows just the right thing to do. The path <CHARNAME> travels is the path of glorious heroics!~
@2275 = ~You're far too soft, bard. Save your sympathies and your coin; the girl will be robbed the moment she reaches the streets.~
@2276 = ~I've met plenty of odd sorts, but that is a distinctly creepy man, <CHARNAME>. I hope we won't be dealing with him too much.~
@2277 = ~You shouldn't judge by appearances so much, Keto. Even though he participates in shady dealings and speaks with a snake-like hum, there is no reason to assume he is not simply a victim of--~
@2278 = ~--oh, fine, he creeps me out, too.~
@2279 = ~<CHARNAME>! That's horrible! How could you participate in forcing animals to fight one another?~
@2280 = ~It's just a little betting, girlie, and I say it's about time we sat down and had a little entertainment; now quit ye simpering, there's a fight to be watching!~
@2281 = ~Well, I'm certainly glad *I'm* not married to you.~
@2282 = ~Lady, were I married to a fine lass liken ye, I wouldn't be needin' to be coming 'ere at all.~
@2283 = ~Should've known that Lehtinan was a slaver! It'll be good to free them and let him get his just rewards!~
@2284 = ~Oh, my... um, <CHARNAME>, I really don't think we should be in here...~
@2285 = ~More sneaking and skullduggery on the horizon I see. Are you sure a full frontal attack wouldn't be wiser?~
@2286 = ~The enemy is far too entrenched now for such an attack. It would be suicidal.~
@2287 = ~As a mere spider spins a web of silk, so does this "silk merchant" spin a web of lies. Ha. Yes, my wit is eternally sharp, is it not?~
@2288 = ~Heh, "The complete and total stranger is right!" What an influence you have on people, <CHARNAME>.~
@2289 = ~On the bright side, they're not tearing the town apart in an orgy of drunkenness.~
@2290 = ~The dregs are always vile and disgusting. This unnamed man would seem to be from the dregs of humanity, to have put such fear into that poor boy.~
@2291 = ~Culture indeed. The world is *surely* a more civilized place for his courageous deeds.~
@2292 = ~It's good to know that understanding and empathy flourish even in a place such as Brynnlaw. Or something.~
@2293 = ~Is that what the ladies say? I know of one lady in particular who wonders how someone like you actually manages to stay alive with all these belligerent pirate lads roaming about.~
@2294 = ~On the whole I prefer my romantics alive. Leave him be, dwarf.~
@2295 = ~A thing or two could be said about that, but I have it on good authority that the Bitch Queen brooks no insolence, so I'll hold my tongue.~
@2296 = ~Were this a play and Saemon the actor, I'd pray they closed the curtains, for this performance is simply pathetic.~
@2297 = ~You play the wanderer, but you are a true seeker, and a seeker of truth. Never stop searching, my child.~
@2298 = ~Wouldn't dream of stopping. I don't know about the "truth" part, that's in the eye of the beholder, but... no, of course I won't stop!~
@2299 = ~I'd offer to tell you a tale of the honor among thieves, but I'd hate to be redundant. That said... no better way to find out what this Mae'Var's really up to than to have a look, is there?~
@2300 = ~Aye, that'll save us the trouble of knocking. I don't suppose we'll be bringing him wine and cheese compliments of the fat Red Wizard down the street, however.~
@2301 = ~How can these poor men possibly be a danger to anybody, let alone the great Shadowmaster? Seems to me somebody's got a cruel streak wide as the countryside.~
@2302 = ~I think I could have gone my whole life and died happy without running into a silver dragon at the end of her rope.~
@2303 = ~Yes. Yes, I'm very sure of it.~
@2304 = ~This is the end, Irenicus! This is the end of your scheming and plotting and destroying! You'll die a tyrant's death, here and now!~ [FWKETOL4]
@2305 = ~All you can do is destroy, Irenicus! You... you destroyed Yoshimo! I'll kill you for that! I'LL KILL YOU!~ [FWKETOL5]
@2306 = ~Hope you heard that part about the blood, <CHARNAME>, but if you missed it I can repeat for you.~
@2307 = ~Ugh. Haven't felt this sick to my stomach since that time I downed a couple of pints of rancid lager.~
@2308 = ~Well, there are the stories about druids who'd just as soon burn down a town as plant a tree. Can't say I've ever met any like that. This one would probably be the expert, if you can trust him.~
@2309 = ~Oh, Hells, I can't believe we're having this conversation.~
@2310 = ~And I can't believe I'm about to say this, but... if you have to leave someone behind, leave me. It... it's more important that Imoen make it out safely.~
@2311 = ~This is going to be exciting! This is going to work! And I'm going to tell everybody about it, and nobody's going to believe it! Me, Keto, aided by Gith, escaping certain mind flaying!~
@2312 = ~Oh, the usual trick. Agree to play the hall, THEN they'll tell you what they pay. Too often it's too little.~
@2313 = ~A desperado on the run, wanted dead or alive? I suppose the Cowled Wizards want this kept quiet. I'd have thought every braggart who could lift a mug would be crowing about this bounty.~
@2314 = ~This was base and just... just nasty of you, <CHARNAME>, and I'm not going to stand for it.~
@2315 = ~Imnesvale? Sort of a two-bit town. Nice folk, but not too bright. Then again, who am I to criticize? And if they're in trouble, they could use a bit of rescuing.~
@2316 = ~Imnesvale? Sort of a two-bit town. Nice folk, but not too bright. Then again, who am I to criticize? And if they're in trouble, they could use a bit of rescuing. If you think Imoen can wait, that is.~
@2317 = ~How could the Cowled Wizards let anything get this bad? This girl needs comfort, not a cage!~
@2318 = ~We didn't come for explanations, we came for Imoen, the most famous second banana of the Sword Coast! I hear she's got pink hair, so you can't have misplaced her. Now hand her over, please.~ [FWKETOZ5]
@2319 = ~Rather ignorant if you ask me. Of course, they probably had a little help turning their back with all the work you people do making magic scary. No excuse, though.~ [FWKETOZ6]
@2320 = ~The little guys won't stand a chance. This doesn't seem at all like a good idea, uh, Veldrin.~
@2321 = ~The Cowled Wizards have a lot of practice lying well. This one doesn't look like much for tales. I know a liar's face... certainly see enough when it comes time to pay the piper.~
@2322 = ~YES! It really will have a happy ending! Death to the villain, and to the victors go the spoils!~
@2323 = ~I think all that's left to do is to tell the elves and collect a little adulation and a little--hey, wait a second. Are you all right?~
@2324 = ~I don't think you realize who you're dealing with, Irenicus. We got this far, and no matter what you try to do to us, we'll just keep coming. <CHARNAME> is funny that way.~
@2325 = ~What happened to us? Irenicus was dead, I saw it! But then you fell, and then I couldn't breathe and I just fell... and kept falling... and now this?!?~ [FWKETOL6]
@2326 = ~<CHARNAME>, no one will ever believe this. Whoever brought us here, they clearly have the wrong people, so let's just find the way out!~ [FWKETOL7]
@2327 = ~Keto, who had little to lose when you first met. Even with her identity and family restored to her, she remains by your side, but she may be sacrificing more than she knows in the fight ahead.~
@2328 = ~Ready for the story of your life, Keto?~
@2329 = ~Keto, I would not think you a coward if you left now. Irenicus is my problem. You do not need to risk his wrath for me.~
@2330 = ~You must be collected, sober, and ready to fight if you are to help me defeat Irenicus. Can you handle that?~
@2331 = ~It took you years to find your family. I can't let you throw away your second chance on something this dangerous.~
@2332 = ~Keto, the vagabond storyteller who left behind the comfort of taverns for the brutal reality of your company. When you met her she fled kobolds; at your command, she would face a man who would be a god.~
@2333 = ~Keto, I know you have a great many journeys ahead of you in this life. Don't throw away your future on what could very well be the death of us all.~
@2334 = ~Aye, it took years to solve my little problem, but if we fail in there, it could take centuries to repair some very big problems--and the histories won't remember us too fondly, either.~ [FWKETOL8]
@2335 = ~Aye! "I Fought a Mad Elf Twice, and Won!" It'll be the talk from here to the plains, you can count on that.~ [FWKETOL9]
@2336 = ~I know all that. But I also know that you'll be glad of my help, come what may.~ [FWKETOM0]
@2337 = ~My head's clear as crystal, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate what this means for you and for all those people out there picking through the ruins of their city.~ [FWKETOM1]
@2338 = ~No, it's surely some sort of madness keepin' us together, <CHARNAME>. But I need to stay, to see how this ends.~ [FWKETOM2]
@2339 = ~Absolutely. All this time with you, I've discovered that there's something that clears the mind about facing adversity--real adversity, not just a cranky crowd.~ [FWKETOM3]
@2340 = ~Aye, both of us have more to do in this life. Seems to me sticking together is the best way to make sure we do it.~ [FWKETOM4]
@2341 = ~Besides, I'll never trust a <CHARNAME> story from the lips of another again. Your tale's as much yours as it is mine now, and I intend to keep it that way.~
@2342 = ~But I'm not here for a story. I'm here because as much as you didn't really need a girl of a bard better at downing a tankard than telling a tale, you need me now.~
@2343 = ~And I like that feeling. Won't give it up, won't give you a reason to think twice about counting on me.~
@2344 = ~Can't expect that I'd let you down now! Without our time together, I wouldn't have screwed up the courage to even answer that invitation. I'd still be rotting in some wine cellar somewhere, and you know it!~
@2345 = ~And I owe Irenicus, for Yoshimo's sake. That bastard took... he took...~
@2346 = ~Wasting valuable time, gabbing about this. Let's do what we came for, <CHARNAME>, and then the drinks are on me, aye?~
@2347 = ~Hey, sounds good to me, I'll take one. Eh, wait, bodies in the water, you said...?~
@2348 = ~I'll, uh, tell you after we make a sale.~
@2349 = ~Mmm, what a desirable fire-haired lass, supple in the most important places. Have we met somewhere before, perhaps, for I feel I have known you for all...~
@2350 = ~Oh, dear, it's you.~
@2351 = ~Heh, Salvanas, still hanging around here? I'd think that after--~
@2352 = ~Shhh!~
@2353 = ~--three months of lonely nights, you'd have given up.~
@2354 = ~One night spent without your tender caress is an eternity too long! There have been others, yes, but none have whispered in my ear with the sweet melodies the minstrel of my heart could sing!~
@2355 = ~Others? What others? Name two.~
@2356 = ~But that would be telling, and expose the tender secrets that only lovers may share! Share with me, and I shall share in return! Share the secrets of your most erotic adventures, my muse!~
@2357 = ~Oh, Salvanas. It's terrible, but I do love seeing you grovel.~
@2358 = ~Ooh! What a pretty voice you have! I'll bet you have all the men hounding after you, you do.~
@2359 = ~Hmm? Oh, I really don't stay in any one place long enough for that.~
@2360 = ~Oh, what a lovely girl this one is; has Nin finally sent some of her courtesans over here to entertain us?~
@2361 = ~Courtesan? Ooohhh... you are *very* mistaken!~
@2362 = ~Oh, yes, fiery, isn't she? And all that feistiness is yours for a mere... two hundred gold.~
@2363 = ~And no need to bother with returning her in the morning, either.~
@2364 = ~Ooh! Really, now?~
@2365 = ~Edwin! You lying bastard! Sir, don't believe a word he says--and I am NOT a courtesan!~
@2366 = ~You! Hey! Lass with the pipes and the cute accent!~
@2367 = ~Hmm? What is it?~
@2368 = ~See this sphere? It can be all yours for only 500 gold pieces! No better bargain in Athkatla!~
@2369 = ~I'd wager it's also the *only* bargain in Athkatla for it. You know, it doesn't seem like a very useful thing for a wandering storyteller...~
@2370 = ~On the contrary, just imagine the tales! "All About My Very Own Sphere in Athkatla, and the Giveaway Bargain Price I Got on It!"~
@2371 = ~Oh! Not bad! But I have a better one: "How I Avoided Scam Artists, and Other Tales of Amn." Thank you, good day!~
@2372 = ~I wish I had red hair like yours. Can I have your hair?~
@2373 = ~I'm afraid it doesn't detach very well... and besides, yours is already pretty.~
@2374 = ~Awww... (sniff) You're no fun.~
@2375 = ~Hey, pretty lady, can I play yer pipes, can I, huh?~
@2376 = ~Sur--oh, what *do* you have on your hands? Um... you know, these are special pipes, only I can use them. Sorry!~
@2377 = ~Wow, ye sure is pretty. Almost as pretty as my momma!~
@2378 = ~Awww... how sweet! Who's your momma?~
@2379 = ~She works all night at the Coronet! She's all important an' stuff, she even gets called the "lady o' the night".~
@2380 = ~Oh, uh, um, well, that's very, ah, nice.~
@2381 = ~Went an' saw one o' them minstrels at the Coronet a few nights ago--bloody entertainers, all garbed up worse an' a circus freak, an' gettin' more gold 'an I've seen in seasons for doing nothing.~
@2382 = ~I don't think you're being very fair. It takes a lot of practice to be at all good in entertainment, and it's just as much work and strife as any other job, and no guaranteed pay, either. If they get more, it's because they take more risks!~
@2383 = ~I s'pose yer one o' em, aye? Make all th' excuses ye want, it don't change nothing. I slave for coppers, an' they dance for gold. Only a slight better 'an a harlot, if ye ask me.~
@2384 = ~What ye thinking, bringing a girl like tha' into th' slums? Miss, thi' ain't any place for ye.~
@2385 = ~I've been in worse places. I assure you, there's not a thing here that I haven't seen before. Well, except for that sphere-thing, maybe.~
@2386 = ~Oh! Haven't 'eard so sweet a voice 'round here for a while. Ye a bardic sort, miss?~
@2387 = ~I like to think I am. It's nice to hear some friendly words.~
@2388 = ~Aye, it is, an' people don't hear or say 'em near often enough. Take care o' yourself, an' tell a pretty tale for me.~
@2389 = ~I'll do my best!~
@2390 = ~Oi, there, missy, shouldn't ye be at home with ye mam an' not running about with adventurin' notions?~
@2391 = ~Madam, no offense, but I vastly prefer my "adventuring notions" to waddling about and complaining about the government.~
@2392 = ~Well! I never!~
@2393 = ~Then perhaps you should?~
@2394 = ~Rude prats, the whole lot o' ye.~
@2395 = ~Well, if isn't me own wayward storyteller back from the high life to see to us lowly scalawags. Where've ye been, leaving us lonely like ye 'ave?~
@2396 = ~Ach, never one to lay on the guilt light, are you? I'm sorry, been trying to work my way back here, but, ah, things happen...~
@2397 = ~O' course they do, but that's why ye make things happen rather 'an wait for 'em to happen to ye! Aw, but look at ye--takin' on such a mopey look, there, an' ye should know I only be jesting.~
@2398 = ~You're too kind. And, aye, I know I have to come back around more than I have. Forgive me?~
@2399 = ~Aye, jest don't be doin' it again! Heh, now what can I be getting for ye an' yer friends? I'm running a tavern here, an' that's what I intend to do!~
@2400 = ~Ask <CHARNAME>; <PRO_HESHE>'s the one that's been so kind as to take me in. Heh, I probably would've been away even longer without <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@2401 = ~Keto, dearie, you're back. It's about time, too, I haven't seen anything but sailors and drunken nobles in an age.~
@2402 = ~Lovely to see you, too, Gracie. Haven't had too much trouble, I hope?~
@2403 = ~No more than usual. And yourself? The Thumb's been awful strapped to get in a good storyteller since you headed off to the Five Flagons with that actor. What was his name?~
@2404 = ~Er... you know, I really don't remember. But, aye, I should've come back to visit. I managed to get into a party, though. Been traveling with <CHARNAME>; when I'm done, though, I'll get myself back here and start talespinning again.~
@2405 = ~See that you do! Good luck to you, too. Now, better get back to my tables.~
@2406 = ~We taking children, now? What the bloody hell are ye doing here?~
@2407 = ~Don't give a damn what YOU think I'm here for; you can think I'm Mae'Var's illegitimate daughter for all I care.~
@2408 = ~There once was a wandering lass
Fearful of her unknown past.
Yet despite her grim worries
she smiles and tells the stories
of lives far removed from an emptied wine glass.~
@2409 = ~What... what is this? Who are you? How do you know me?~
@2410 = ~Oh, missus, ye seem far too nice a lass to be wandering 'round here! There be all sorts o' nasty sorts making trouble for a girl like ye...~
@2411 = ~I appreciate the concern, madam, but I'm able to look out for myself. I have been for a long time. Besides, I'm not just some sort of wayward traveler--I'm an adventurer!~
@2412 = ~A true pity, then, for ye. Good day, doubt I'll see ye alive after today, sure enough.~
@2413 = ~Ooo, pretty li'l way o' talking ye got there, girl, an' a pretty li'l bottom to go with it. Come on o'er with me, darlin', I'll listen to ye scream me name all night!~
@2414 = ~How about 'no'? <CHARNAME>, would you mind getting this... thing... off me?~
@2415 = ~Oy, sweetie! Ye got enough left innat bottle for you, me, and me best mate Reg ta have a good time?~
@2416 = ~No, but there's plenty enough left to hurt when it's smashed over your head. Now, breathing room, maybe?~
@2417 = ~Time to FEED!~
@2418 = ~Mussst go! Musssst tell!~
@2419 = ~They've certainly done a good job keeping this a secret. Don't think I've heard of that. Makes me wonder just what they had to do to keep it to themselves...~
@2420 = ~Pretty lucky for him that we came along, if this great and mighty, uh, fish king can't handle his rebel problem on his own. Makes me wonder what the other side thinks of all this.~
@2421 = ~Nonsense! Outsiders bring fresh tales and fresh ideas and fresh--~
@2422 = ~All right. Fine. They don't bring anything but trouble. Have it your way!~
@2423 = ~Maybe they just need to be doused with a bucket of water. Works well enough to get a surly crowd under control.~
@2424 = ~Aye, I suppose we should have just given them a smack and made them see reason. But don't worry, Lord Logan. They can serve as an example--or at least a warning--to the next lot of petty squabblers. I'll see to that.~
@2425 = ~Ach, <CHARNAME>... I'm sure it's not as bad as it looks. I mean, I'm sure there's someone who can help. We'll find a way.~
@2426 = ~Gotta admire their tenacity, but isn't it just possible that her ship has sailed?~
@2427 = ~Ah well. Hopeful speculation's never bothered me.~
@2428 = ~You'd be very popular around the Border Kingdoms, if you ever give up what you're doing here.~
@2429 = ~That's... that's... just uh, wonderful, male.~
@2430 = ~Oh, I've only heard of such things once or twice, I never thought them real! To see what he could see... doubt we've time for that sort of thing, though.~
@2431 = ~You--I can't believe it. Not even in the worst rumors were you *this* low, <CHARNAME>! You won't profit by this! I swear!~
@2432 = ~Imoen doesn't have to stand alone, Bodhi. Imoen doesn't have to snake-charm others into helping her. That's why we'll win.~
@2433 = ~<CHARNAME>... I know what that was... what you were. I can't believe it's possible, I can't believe you--~
@2434 = ~Never mind, that's not important. I don't know what it all means. But we'll find out, and try to--hope to--keep it from coming out again.~
@2435 = ~Can't say I feel too badly about that one, but if he's really all that stands between us and the inmates, we'll need to think fast our our feet, <CHARNAME>. No problem, right?~
@2436 = ~So long as all goes well, once a troupe of actors gets involved? Higgold, my man, you're quite the optimist.~
@2437 = ~Tut, tut. Such little confidence in your fellows. Such dark clouds over a performance shall not give the players the vim and confidence they need!~
@2438 = ~Seems to me that the belief is what gives a curse like this its power. So I guess if they believe it, we'll have to as well.~
@2439 = ~Jenna, you've got what you've got, and she's got what she's got. You don't want what she's got, trust me.~
@2440 = ~Might just be the fumes from Samuel's private stock rotting out the timbers. Fine brews, but have you caught whiff of his Undermountain Reserve? The stuff rusts nails!~
@2441 = ~Can hardly blame <CHARNAME> for that! Look at what <PRO_HESHE> was given to work with! I mean, for a playhouse under a bar, it's been a playhouse under a bar!~
@2442 = ~I'd say it was a bloody good show. <CHARNAME>'s had to do far more than <PRO_HISHER> part in this, in the middle of everything else, and the play had a beginning, middle, and ending. All three parts!~
@2443 = ~Best I've seen in this dive or many another. Higgold's right, <CHARNAME>, this was truly a magnificent performance, yourself included!~
@2444 = ~Aye! And you'd have the focus to do it yourself after being chased halfway across Amn by everyone's demon and their brother?~
@2445 = ~Me, I have a rule about this: if you're old enough to heft it, you're old enough to drink it... but you lads look like you'd be blown over by a feather, to say nothing of a stiff belt of ale!~
@2446 = ~Couldn't tell you what manner of sorcery he's victim of, but I will say he speaks the truth. Haer'Dalis isn't a good enough actor to fake this.~
@2447 = ~Are you certain we can't leave him here?~
@2448 = ~And delivered me into the welcoming arms of yon demure robin, no less? Truly, the Planes are aligned most conspicuously.~
@2449 = ~Don't flatter yourself. If it was up to me... oh, never mind.~
@2450 = ~Poor Raelis. She really does mean well. Maybe next time she'll know not to put so much faith in her "sparrow."~ [FWKETOZ1]
@2451 = ~And thank you, Raelis, for not paying more for the man than you did for the gem. I'd hate to have to turn down good coin like that.~
@2452 = ~Raelis, please! <CHARNAME> is not trying to cheat you, <PRO_HESHE> has important work ahead!~
@2453 = ~Eh. They're not bad, <CHARNAME>. They're not as good as they think they are, but they're not bad.~
@2454 = ~What's this? Where's the Great One? Must be entranced by his own reflection and refused to tear himself away.~ [FWKETOZ0]
@2455 = ~Surely you don't... want him back?~
@2456 = ~It's probably not half as mysterious as she makes it sound. More likely he just fell down a well.~
@2457 = ~Hope springs eternal, anyway.~
@2458 = ~Keto? What did this Haer'Dalis ever do to you?~
@2459 = ~Nothing important. Let's just hope it never happens to you, aye?~
@2460 = ~As much as I hope I never see the man's face again, there's a part of me that wouldn't mind rescuing him... just to lord it over him the rest of his days.~
@2461 = ~But if it doesn't pique your interest, we've much to do besides. So I'll not shed a tear for him, aye?~
@2462 = ~We wouldn't abandon you, Yoshimo. What one mage can do, another can undo!~
@2463 = ~There is no time, Keto. No time to do anything but what I am sentenced to do.~
@2464 = ~There must be some way, Yoshimo! What one mage can do, another can undo!~
@2465 = ~You're not muddled, Yoshimo. You just like your independence.~
@2466 = ~Of course. It is not a thing easily surrendered. And I am sure our alliance will not need to be a lengthy one.~
@2467 = ~I know it was a very wise man who once said that "fear is for those of no confidence." I'm sure if that man were here, we would all feel a lot better!~

@3000 = ~Ulga no want to crush angry humans. Ulga want to sing.~ [PGULGA01]
@3001 = ~Ay! 'Allo, Keto!~
@3002 = ~Ay! 'Allo, Vincenzo!~
@3003 = ~Awww, why ye want to encourage him? Can'cha say mornin' and evenin' like normal folk?~
@3004 = ~Sorry.~
@3005 = ~Mornin,' Willet.~
@3006 = ~Evenin,' Willet.~
@3007 = ~Top o' the <DAYNIGHT> to you, Wil-let!~
@3008 = ~Jest a blabbermouth, you are.~
@3009 = ~You've got my number, all right.~
@3010 = ~Shut yer flap, boy, or I'll douse ye in molasses an' string ye up fer the bears!~
@3011 = ~Now, Miss Keto, ye in particulars I be wishing to see. I've a notice for you here, all twittered up for special delivery, so I'm deliverin' it!~
@3012 = ~A message for me? Whoa, this is some quality parchment. Who'd you steal it from, eh?~
@3013 = ~None of yer teasing, lass. 'Twas a superfine lord or such wot arranged it. Appeared on a moonbeam with singing faeries 'e did!~
@3014 = ~Crumbs, 'ere comes another likely story.~
@3015 = ~I hate to say it, but I agree with you, sprout.~
@3016 = ~I don't know anyone who skips on moonbeams, and singing faeries? Too ostentatious. The people I buddy with aren't so... aren't so...~
@3017 = ~Urrrp! Pardon me. Turnip reflex.~ [JANJAN23]
@3018 = ~Err... classy!~
@3019 = ~Hey! I'm standing right here!~
@3020 = ~Spit once in a temple, and they never let you forget it.~
@3021 = ~Why, that hurt my feelings.~
@3022 = ~Are you kidding? I ooze class from my armpits! See?~
@3023 = ~I am not amused.~
@3024 = ~Ach, so you are! Oops. Moving right along...~
@3025 = ~But they're very stuck on their own importance, so it balances out!~
@3026 = ~Hear that? You can't take <CHARNAME> anywhere!~
@3027 = ~See someone make enough umber hulk heads explode, and you forget a <PRO_MANWOMAN> has a sensitive side. Sorry, <CHARNAME>.~
@3028 = ~So this scroll, Vincenzo. Any idea what it's about?~
@3029 = ~Aye, it be an invitation to a contest!~
@3030 = ~A contest?~
@3031 = ~A competition! Feats o' skill, each more dazzlin' than the last!~
@3032 = ~Feats of skill? And I'M invited? Now I'm positive there's been some mistake!~
@3033 = ~No mistake! It's the Pan-Amnish Bardic Competition! Your name is definitely on the list of invited contestants. Two days hence, this very spot will be crawlin' with poets and minstrels. The famous, the infamous--wait n' see!~
@3034 = ~Stayin' here. They sure are gonna be disappointed.~
@3035 = ~That's enough out of ye, boy. I'll be tellin' Minister Lloyd what ye think of his plan to promote the village. We aren't just a gabble of gooseheads living in the forest, for all your honkin'. We've a stage in the town square! Imnesvale has culture!~
@3036 = ~Culture? Imnesvale has green bits growin' in last night's pinecone stew, I give ye. Let's see 'ow the mighty artistes like it.~
@3037 = ~The famous, the infamous, and ME.~
@3038 = ~And Vincenzo, with so much work to do! Never have I hosted such fine folk under me roof before!~
@3039 = ~Never 'as he cleaned before!~
@3040 = ~Yer mouth needs cleanin', squatter. Careful ye don't find a broom innit!~
@3041 = ~As fer ye, miss, here be yer invite. Keep it safe; you'll have to present it t' compete. I do hopes ye'll be stayin' round these parts t' win the prize n' glory!~
@3042 = ~I will have the final word on that matter. I am in charge of this group.~
@3043 = ~That depends. What do you want to do, Keto?~
@3044 = ~Prize? There is a prize?~
@3045 = ~Of course she will! No ifs, ands, or buts!~
@3046 = ~A bardic competition, and I wasn't invited. This is a travesty!~
@3047 = ~This is so unfair. You get a letter, and it turns out to be a summons to a prestigious contest. I come across a letter, and it's always the invitation issued to every assassin from here to the Sword Coast promising a fortune for my head on a salver.~
@3048 = ~Wait a fireballin' second! You're not the boss of me! Except... Maybe when we're killing some ferocious beast, or deciding when to make camp, or who gets the last of those really good arrows with the spiky yellow heads...~
@3049 = ~Okay, okay. You are the boss of me. But don't go thinking that means you're in charge!~
@3050 = ~This contest, <CHARNAME>, it's what I've been waiting for: a real opportunity to show what I can do. Not some tenday engagement at a gritty tavern in the Docks where the patrons confuse my tip cistern for a spittoon. No, this... this is the chance of a lifetime!~ [FWKETOH0]
@3051 = ~I know there's a lot we've promised to do, a lot of it urgent. I'm behind you, I'm part of the team, but I really want... no, I really NEED to be a part of this competition. Will you stay around town with me? Please. I could use your support.~ [FWKETOH3]
@3052 = ~If it is that important to you, sure. We can squeeze in a few extra days in the Umar Hills.~
@3053 = ~Say, does that scroll mention any money in the big prize? This operation is not getting anywhere on wishes and moonbeams, you know.~
@3054 = ~I hope we will still be in the area for the competition, but I cannot promise anything, Keto. You said it yourself: there is a lot we have agreed to do, and people are counting on us to come through.~
@3055 = ~Of course! The arts must come first, for only art makes life bearable.~
@3056 = ~If I cannot be in this bardic competition, you cannot be, either. Artistic solidarity!~
@3057 = ~You want us to abandon our responsibilities when lives are hanging in the balance, all so you can prance around some silly jamboree of musicians and bad poets? You have to be kidding me!~
@3058 = ~If you must stay for this competition, you will have to remain here alone. I have to put Imoen's rescue first. Can you understand how important her safety is to me?~
@3059 = ~If you must stay for this competition, you will have to remain here alone. My soul is at stake, Keto! I don't have a second to waste.~
@3060 = ~Stay here? Absolutely not.~
@3061 = ~Yes, indeed, Vincenzo said there was a prize. There's more to this than goodies and gold, though.~
@3062 = ~I will? But, but...~
@3063 = ~Well, I suppose I'd be a fool not to, eh?~
@3064 = ~There, there. Dramatics are well and good, I see you're emoting jealousy right now, but spare me a thought, eh?~
@3065 = ~'Tis a disappointment, I wager. Being the Savior of the Sword Coast, you'd think a <PRO_MANWOMAN> would get a thank-you scroll now and then.~
@3066 = ~Artistic selfishness is more like it. Come on, <CHARNAME>, you're always being asked to save this bacon, or rule that day. Let me have my one invitation to a contest!~
@3067 = ~When you put it that way... maybe I'm being selfish. It's a lot to ask of you, hanging around the Umar Hills for days eating pinecone stew, putting other obligations on hold, all because I want to prove myself in a way that doesn't require bloodshed and conjuring.~
@3068 = ~You're right. People's lives are at stake. I can't ask you to abandon anyone for a contest, no matter how badly I crave to go.~
@3069 = ~You have to have caught on by now that all this danger and peril is not my strong suit. I'm not a natural adventurer. I think it's for the best if I take the challenge by myself, and stay here in Imnesvale through the competition. Tell you what: if I don't knock 'em dead, I'll track you down in three days.~
@3070 = ~Ay! Look what the ogres drug in! Ready for the contest, Miss Keto?~
@3071 = ~More or less, Vincenzo. As in, more wine, less talking about the competition--I'm nervous enough already!~
@3072 = ~You, miss! You have an artistic flair about you. Are you a bard by profession?~
@3073 = ~Yes, some people would call me a bard. Some of them would even say it without snickering.~
@3074 = ~Artistic flair, you say? What gave me away? The pipes hanging from my belt? The ink stains on my fingers? The well-honed quill?~
@3075 = ~You're the noisiest talker in the room. I figured you liked the attention.~
@3076 = ~Hmm.~
@3077 = ~On the off chance, could your name be Keto Riven?~
@3078 = ~Yes...? Uh oh. I don't owe you money, do I?~
@3079 = ~It's not that I skipped town, honest! I don't remember every little tab the morning after a really good night, you see...~
@3080 = ~Calm yourself, miss. No debts here, except that a gentleman paid me the best coin I've seen in a tenday to deliver this letter to Keto Riven should she happen into my establishment. I'll give it to you, and thank Waukeen for the profit.~
@3081 = ~A gentleman, you say? Paying money to deliver a note to me?~
@3082 = ~These days, it's a spectacle to see someone throw such coin down for a simple errand. Obviously, he was not from these parts, else the genies would have emptied his purse by now.~
@3083 = ~Yes, he had a measure of the artistic flair, as well, and a procession of pages sprinkling his path with rose petals. Not a lord of Trademeet, I assure you. The flower sellers would make a fortune off such regular custom. We should all be so blessed!~
@3084 = ~Here's your scroll. Read it in wealth.~
@3085 = ~Sheesh, who would send me such a message? I don't know...~
@3086 = ~Don't get too excited. That note could be ire from a critic.~
@3087 = ~That scroll must contain something important. Who would hand out good coin just to send you their shopping list?~
@3088 = ~I am not surprised you doubt it. It is not like you are terribly important. Are there wonderful awful prophecies about your existence? No, I did not think so.~
@3089 = ~Careful. That scroll may contain bad news.~
@3090 = ~Are you going to just stand there? Open it!~
@3091 = ~Mail? I love mail! You know, except the random missives routinely sent to every assassin from here to the Sword Coast promising a fortune for my head on a salver. That mail I can do without.~
@3092 = ~What does it say?~
@3093 = ~Hello, my good smilin'--Keto! Well, if it isn't the prettiest coward to set foot in the Flagons! Need a refill?~
@3094 = ~On the house?~
@3095 = ~Just this fifty-third time, I will. I've a business to run, remember?~
@3096 = ~But a generous heart. That's why you're my favorite bartender, Thunderburp.~
@3097 = ~Ah, I bet you say that to all the bartenders.~
@3098 = ~Yes, but you're my favorite out of all the bartenders I say it to!~
@3099 = ~Ha! Fortune smile on you, my friend! By my wager, you've not long to wait for that blessing to come true. See what I have for you?~
@3100 = ~A splendid gent with his own entourage of golden heralds dropped it off not an hour past.~
@3101 = ~A scroll? For me? From people with gold? Are you sure?~
@3102 = ~Sure as I just filled your wine bottle! Hate to miss the reading, but the line at the bar's picking up. Don't be a stranger, lass!~
@3103 = ~Huh, <CHARNAME>. Who would send me a message by courier? I don't know...~
@3104 = ~Ye there, girl. The one with the twinkle in yer eyes.~
@3105 = ~You mean me?~
@3106 = ~O' course! I'd hardly be talking t' one of the pickled plums I call me regular customers!~
@3107 = ~By me dearly departed Dickie, what was I thinking? You ARE one of me regular customers!~
@3108 = ~Pickled and proud, ma'am. Or twinkley, if it pleases you enough to grant a round on the house.~
@3109 = ~Nothing be pleasing me that much, lass. Ye want a drink, ye'll take a seat and put down yer coin like the rest of the sots.~
@3110 = ~Yes, ma'am. I'll mind my best sot behavior.~
@3111 = ~Don't be cheeky, girl. I have business with you. A courier happened by t'other day with a missive for ye. Pranced in here bold as brass, he did, as if the man was too good for the Seven Vales. I had half me mind set t' swinging a flagon upside his uppity head! T' other half was set t' cleaving his--~
@3112 = ~Ahem. A missive for me, you say?~
@3113 = ~Patience be a virtue in a maid, lassie, as is sobriety.~
@3114 = ~Bah! What am I yammering on t' ye for? Time I was scrubbing the floors... AGAIN.~
@3115 = ~Here's ye're letter. Careful ye don't drop it. It looks like a fancy invitation. Hoo-dee-dee!~
@3116 = ~Huh. Who'd send me a fancy invitation? I don't know...~
@3117 = ~Swab me eyes, do they deceive. Never h'expected to see you so soon, Keto-girl. I've got some booty for you.~
@3118 = ~It's kind of you to offer, Thumbster, but I've never really thought of you in that way... Oh! A scroll! For me? Heh, I guess I misunderstood.~
@3119 = ~A courier dropped it off a whiles ago, said ta hand 'er t' the storyteller, Keto. Sorry 'bout the hole, missy. Blasted idgit wants something handed, he oughta conscript a fella without a hook!~
@3120 = ~Agreed, but a courier, you say? Who'd want to drop good coin to send me a letter?~
@3121 = ~All toitied up he was, too, like an' admiral's poodle. Looks like you've caught the interest of a better class of people, Keto. One that can toss off more than an innkeep's wages fer your stories, by me glass eye.~
@3122 = ~You think? Really? I don't know...~
@3123 = ~Excuse me, miss, but you are named Keto, yes? The storyteller of renown who has spun tales in this very inn?~
@3124 = ~Hmmph. Until you turned me out on my ear, yes.~
@3125 = ~'Twas not for a lack of entertainment, miss, but a lack of silence. All that clapping and cheering belied the good name of this establishment. People come to the Mithrest Inn for peace and a sound night's slumber.~
@3126 = ~Hire me again. Next time, I'll whisper bedtime stories.~
@3127 = ~You do seem quite in demand lately, miss. There is your present company, the courier... I shall think on it.~
@3128 = ~Courier? What courier?~
@3129 = ~The one that left this note for you, should you pass through the door. He caused quite a hullaballoo, I must say. There were trumpets, and a pony... the noise was aggrievous!~
@3130 = ~A note? For me?~
@3131 = ~Oh, yes, yes. Here it is. I will leave you to peruse it at your leisure. Do pardon the disturbance.~
@3132 = ~Hey, you there! Kitty! I've got somethin' for you.~
@3133 = ~Bernard, we've been through this before. My name is Keto. KEY-TOE. Say it with me now.~
@3134 = ~What I've got, Kitty -~
@3135 = ~Keto. C'mon, it's not that difficult! Just two teensy syllables, rhymes with...~
@3136 = ~Slow?~
@3137 = ~Oh, what's the use? You'll never remember who I am!~
@3138 = ~That ain't true, not a word of it. Clear as a bell I recall the last time you performed here at the Copper Coronet. The catcalls, the mugs of ale hurtling at your head, the uncanny way you caught more brew in your mouth than hit the floor...~
@3139 = ~I drank in self-defense. And my throat was dry.~
@3140 = ~Ah, I'm just funnin' with you, girl. I knows your name sure as it's printed "KETO RIVEN" on this here scroll.~
@3141 = ~A scroll? For me?~
@3142 = ~A courier dropped it off a little while ago. Not too shabby-looking a fella.~
@3143 = ~A courier? Who'd want to pay good money to send me a letter?~
@3144 = ~Don't get too excited. It could be from a critic.~
@3145 = ~Careful. It may be bad news.~
@3146 = ~A critic, huh? Then everybody'd better stand back. Heh, it'll probably explode when I open it.~
@3147 = ~You'd be surprised. I've met some strange people on the road. I once had a fellow send me a tribute after one of my particularly memorable performances.~
@3148 = ~Unfortunately, he must not have remembered me too fondly. He sent a dirty stocking.~
@3149 = ~The right one?~
@3150 = ~The left one?~
@3151 = ~That sounds pretty rude.~
@3152 = ~Ouch. A clean stocking would not have been much better, mind you.~
@3153 = ~I guess you must have really stunk.~
@3154 = ~No, the left. Why? Is a dirty right stocking somehow worse?~
@3155 = ~Yes, actually. I read a report once in the ledgers of Candlekeep from the Laundrymaster at the Court of Riativin. He documented that right stockings were, on average, tweleve percent smellier than their left counterparts.~
@3156 = ~No. I was just curious. Magic is in the details, you know?~
@3157 = ~He sent you the left stocking? NO! Not the LEFT stocking!~
@3158 = ~Yes, the left. Why? Is a dirty left stocking somehow worse?~
@3159 = ~No, vastly superior. Why, some gnomes hoard dirty left socks as a good luck charm. It's also the secret spice in turnip stew.~
@3160 = ~He sent you the left stocking? No! Not the LEFT stocking!~
@3161 = ~Whaddya know? You learn something new every day. Something weird, and something new.~
@3162 = ~Glad to know you're interested.~
@3163 = ~What? What's wrong with the...?~
@3164 = ~Oh. Har, har. You're a riot, <CHARNAME>.~
@3165 = ~Good luck, huh? Maybe I shouldn't have tossed it away with the rubbish. I could always use some luck, if not turnip stew.~
@3166 = ~Hey, believe me. I've known ruder.~
@3167 = ~I don't know. It might have been useful. A sock could make a fair slingshot in a pinch.~
@3168 = ~Still, let us hope we're never that pinched for weapons against the raging beasties, hmm?~
@3169 = ~Not as much as the stocking.~
@3170 = ~It's nice to know you appreciate my worth, <CHARNAME>!~
@3171 = ~(Jerk.)~
@3172 = ~Then again, just look at the quality of this parchment. Ach, I think I'm getting it all smudgy.~
@3173 = ~Don't say that! No need to be a pessimist until after I've opened it!~
@3174 = ~All right, all right! I'm hurrying!~
@3175 = ~Fair enough. If anyone's confused me for an assassin, they're in for a big surprise, eh?~
@3176 = ~Oh, my... this script is pretty fancy. I've never gotten anything so... so...~
@3177 = ~So obviously meant for someone other than me.~
@3178 = ~Of course it is for you. Your name is on the scroll, remember?~
@3179 = ~What are you hesitating for? Read it!~
@3180 = ~Fine. Hand it over, then.~
@3181 = ~Do you want me to take a look at it for you? I have obligations. Urgent obligations. Not to sound pushy, but all your pussy-footing is not getting that parchment read.~
@3182 = ~You're right. What am I waiting for? This scroll isn't going to read itself!~
@3183 = ~Hey! It's addressed to ME. Go get your own mysterious letter.~
@3184 = ~Let's see... what does it say...?~
@3185 = ~"Felicitous tidings to Keto Riven,

You have been selected from amongst the finest minstrels, songster, poets and
talespinners spanning the country to present, with assured illustrious skill
and revelry, your craft in the Pan-Amnish Bard Invitational..."~
@3186 = ~That sounds impressive.~
@3187 = ~"Amongst the finest..." Do they actually know you?~
@3188 = ~Bards from across the country? The entire country? And they sent an invitation to you?~
@3189 = ~Listen, there's more. Get a load of this--~
@3190 = ~Hey, cut it out! This is just getting good!~
@3191 = ~That's what it says...~
@3192 = ~My hands are shaking. Why are my hands shaking?~
@3193 = ~It's just a competition. A Pan-Amnish competition. A Pan-Amnish competiton of bards. The finest bards from across the country... ~
@3194 = ~Listen, there's more.~
@3195 = ~The letter goes on to say:

"...Competitors should bring this invitation to compete as proof of their identity to the town of Imnesvale by"--~
@3196 = ~Oh! It's only a couple of days from now, <CHARNAME>! There's a prize for the winner, and whoever topped the best bards across Amn... well, that would bring enough fame to keep a gal in wine and roast beef for the rest of her life!~
@3197 = ~I know there's a lot we've promised to do, a lot of it urgent. I'm behind you, I'm part of the team, but I really want... no, I really NEED to go to this competition. Will you make the detour with me?~ [FWKETOH1]
@3198 = ~Please. I'd rather not go alone.~ [FWKETOH2]
@3199 = ~Maybe...is there any money in this prize you mentioned? This operation is not getting anywhere on wishes and moonbeams, you know.~
@3200 = ~I hope we make it to the competition, but I cannot promise anything, Keto. You said it yourself: there is a lot we have agreed to do, and people are counting on us to come through.~
@3201 = ~You want us to abandon our responsibilities, when lives are hanging in the balance, all so you can prance around some silly jamboree of musicians and bad poets? You have to be kidding me!~
@3202 = ~If you must go to this competition, you will have to go it alone. I have to put Imoen's rescue first. Can you understand how important her safety is to me?~
@3203 = ~If you must go to this competition, you will have to go it alone. My soul is at stake, Keto! I don't have a second to waste.~
@3204 = ~A detour? Absolutely not.~
@3205 = ~Thanks, <CHARNAME>. I appreciate it.~
@3206 = ~Money? There are more important things than money, you know.~
@3207 = ~Eh, who am I kidding? I hope the prize is in hard coin, but, even if it's not, this is my destiny we're talking about here!~
@3208 = ~Trust me. Destinies are really overrated.~
@3209 = ~In that case, I suppose we can spare a couple extra days in the Umar Hills.~
@3210 = ~No, I am not taking a detour unless I know there is something in it for me.~
@3211 = ~Sure, you'd say that. Look at your destiny. It's laid out wider than a dragon's buttocks.~
@3212 = ~But me, all I want is a teensy-tiny bit of destiny. The feeling that I belong somewhere doing one thing more than any other. To find what I'm really made of, and if this is really my calling. Is that too much to ask?~
@3213 = ~No, I suppose that is understandable. I guess we can spare a few extra days in the Umar Hills.~
@3214 = ~Yes. If you must go to this competition, you will have to go it alone. I have to put Imoen first. Can you understand how important her safety is to me?~
@3215 = ~Yes. If you must go to this competition, you will have to go it alone. My soul is at stake, Keto! I don't have a second to waste.~
@3216 = ~All right. I hope we make it to the competition, but I cannot promise anything, Keto. You said it yourself: there is a lot we have agreed to do, and people are counting on us to come through.~
@3217 = ~Yes, it is too much. Let it drop. We have more important things to accomplish.~
@3218 = ~I thought I knew cheap, but you take the all-sorts. Too much of a stretch for you to risk going without a payoff? Fine. I'll just have to make a go of it on my own.~
@3219 = ~But, hey... I should be used to that by now.~
@3220 = ~Right, right. Responsibilities, we gave our word, bodies in peril...got it.~
@3221 = ~I just really WANT to go! They invited me! I've never been invited to do anything before but leave!~
@3222 = ~Ah, but you're right, <CHARNAME>. Let's get a move on.~
@3223 = ~I knew you'd understand, <CHARNAME>. As sure as my name is Keto... err, well, as sure as I am standing here, you're the greatest!~
@3224 = ~No. I'm not kidding.~
@3225 = ~This competition... I can feel it's my destiny, you know? Like I have to go. They invited me. I've never been invited to do anything before but leave! If you aren't willing to stand by me as a friend, then I guess I'll just have to make a go of it on my own.~
@3226 = ~When you put it that way... maybe I'm being selfish, asking you to come with me.~
@3227 = ~Sorry, you're right. People's lives are at stake. I can't ask you to abandon anyone for a contest.~
@3228 = ~As for me, you have to have caught on by now that all this danger and peril is not my strong suit. I'm not a natural adventurer. I think it's for the best if I take a detour. Tell you what: if I don't knock 'em dead, I'll track you down in three days.~
@3229 = ~But I don't see it as a waste! Not for me.~
@3230 = ~I guess that was your point. (sighs) You have to have caught on by now that all this danger and peril is not my strong suit. I'm not a natural adventurer. I think it's for the best if I take a detour.~
@3231 = ~You're hot on Irenicus's trail. I understand that, and I know I'm probably leaving you in a lurch, but you've got your destiny, and I've got mine. So long, <CHARNAME>. Stay safe, and maybe I'll catch up with you when you least expect it.~
@3232 = ~No? You're saying "no," just like that? You aren't even going to string me along a little?~
@3233 = ~This competition... They invited me. ME! I've never been invited to do anything before but leave! If you aren't willing to stand by me as a friend, or even a decent living being, then I guess I'll just have to make a go of it on my own.~
@3234 = ~<CHARNAME>?!? What are we doing HERE? I need to be at that competition! They've probably started without me!~
@3235 = ~I'm not going to rely on you caring about what's best for me. Fare thee well, for this is one bard looking out for herself from now on.~
@3236 = ~It's been two days, <CHARNAME>. If we don't leave for the Umar Hills soon, I'll miss the competition in Imnesvale.~ [FWKETOH4]
@3237 = ~You are right, Keto. We had better get a move on. You don't want to miss that!~
@3238 = ~We'll get there. There is just one more thing...~
@3239 = ~Are you still harping on about that contest? I expected you to forget it by now.~
@3240 = ~It's been two days, <CHARNAME>. I know you don't want to go to Imnesvale, but I've been thinking about it. The more I think, the more I want to go, and if we don't leave for the Umar Hills soon, I'll miss the competition entirely!~ [FWKETOH5]
@3241 = ~Can we journey there now? Please? It really is very important. To me.~
@3242 = ~I did warn you, Keto, that it might not be possible.~
@3243 = ~It's tough, but those are the breaks.~
@3244 = ~Nope. I don't. Thanks muchly for understanding, <CHARNAME>. Want me to lead the way?~
@3245 = ~True, you were honest. A gal can't really expect more than that.~
@3246 = ~No, wait, I can. This is important to me, but I can't ask you to abandon your own destiny for a contest.~
@3247 = ~You have to have caught on by now that I'm not a natural adventurer. I think it's for the best if I take a detour and see what this competition holds for me. Tell you what: if I don't knock 'em dead, I'll track you down in a couple of days.~
@3248 = ~No! No excuses! There'll just be another last minute quest, then another, then another, and I'll never find out if I have what it takes to win a competition!~
@3249 = ~I know it's selfish to demand we go, so I won't. I can't ask you to abandon your own destiny for a contest, for my dream.~
@3250 = ~You... you never planned to go in the first place, did you? You were just... stringing me along. "Yeah, sure, we'll make the contest, Keto. Now fall in line and do what I say, Keto." To think I was gullible enough to believe you!~
@3251 = ~This competition... They invited me. ME! I've never been invited to do anything before but leave! And you... you almost made me miss it! If you aren't willing to stand by me as a friend, or even a decent living being, then I guess I'll just have to make a go of it on my own.~
@3252 = ~Miss Riven! You're the last one to arrive. They're all millin' about in Vincenzo's, so why not go in, introduce yourself and rest a spell?~
@32520 = ~Most of the bards are a bit daft an' don't even realize there's monsters waitin' in the trees t' kill 'em dead. Miss Tewes just says "The show must go on."~
@3253 = ~Be sure to present your invitation to Tewes when you're ready to compete, an' we can get the show on the road!~
@3254 = ~Oh, no! Death has come to what should have been a joyous affair! I don't see what we can do but cancel the competition!~ [PGTEWS10]
@3255 = ~Welcome to our little impromptu gathering place for the bardic competition. Please enjoy the company, and if you know any invitees who have not checked in yet, please ask them to come to me directly.~ [PGTEWS11]
@3256 = ~Why was I not invited? I am a bard of no small talent, and I was ignored? For shame!~
@3257 = ~I think there was some mistake. I'm certain if you knew what I could do, I would have been asked to participate.~
@3258 = ~Very well.~
@3259 = ~I'm very sorry, but if you did not receive an invitation, you must not have been the sort of performer our organizers were looking for. I don't make the rules, I just run the contest.~
@3260 = ~Why, it's Keto Riven, isn't it? I hope you're ready for the competition. You're the last to check in, so if you just hand me your invitation, we can begin the performances!~ [PGTEWS00]
@3261 = ~We, uh, dropped it or something.~
@3262 = ~Here you are.~
@3263 = ~I'd like to sniff around a bit more first before we start the competition.~
@3264 = ~Oh, dear! Well, you must find it soon if you want to compete! No participants allowed without proof of invitation!~
@3265 = ~Fine! Enjoy yourself out there! Break a leg!~
@3266 = ~Fine, fine, do introduce yourself to everyone. Just don't tarry forever!~
@3267 = ~Finally, we're here in Imnesvale. The competition is just a few hours away, and... well, just between you and me and the dustclouds, I never expected to be so nervous.~ [FWKETOH6]
@3268 = ~You're nervous? You don't look it to me.~
@3269 = ~Nervous, huh? I cannot say I blame you. If I were in your boots, I would be shaking like a hamster in a lion's den.~
@3270 = ~Nervous? Don't true performers channel that extra energy into enlivening their performance?~
@3271 = ~Nervous? True performers can channel that extra energy into enlivening their performance.~
@3272 = ~Nervous, huh? I cannot say I blame you. If I were in your boots, I would be shaking like a willow in a rainstorm.~
@3273 = ~I noticed. You are as jumpy as a grasshopper in a frying pan.~
@3274 = ~Maybe you are confusing excitement for nerves. Consider the triumph if you win, Keto!~
@3275 = ~I am worried, too, Keto. If you let your nerves get to you, you will make a fool of yourself. Worse, this trip will have been a waste we can't afford.~
@3276 = ~You should have thought of that before you pestered me into coming here for your grand opportunity.~
@3277 = ~Oooh, Minsc has seen this! But fear not, little Keto! Boo won the day, and so shall you!~
@3278 = ~Ugh, that was one simile I don't think I needed before the single biggest day of my life!~
@3279 = ~Beggars can't be choosers, Keto.~
@3280 = ~If you like that, I have a few more turns of phrase I'll sell to you for next to nothing.~
@3281 = ~You should do what I do. Don't care.~
@3282 = ~Why are you so anxious, Keto? It is not as if you have never performed before an audience before.~
@3283 = ~So you're nervous. Don't true performers channel that extra energy into enlivening their performance?~
@3284 = ~They can't all be winners. But consider, Keto--true performers can channel that extra nervous energy into enlivening their performance.~
@3285 = ~Are you sure you aren't confusing excitement for nerves? Consider the triumph if you win, Keto!~
@3286 = ~I hate to think that you are that anxious, Keto. You are bound to make a fool of yourself if you don't get over it before the competition. Worse, this trip will be a waste we cannot afford.~
@3287 = ~Are you blind? Look! My hand is shaking like a willow in a rainstorm!~
@3288 = ~So it is. Why are you so anxious, Keto? It is not as if you have never performed before an audience before.~
@3289 = ~Oh. That's from nerves? I assumed you were running low on wine.~
@3290 = ~I see, but don't true performers channel that extra energy into enlivening their performance?~
@3291 = ~Yes, you are nervous, but true performers can channel that extra energy into enlivening their performance.~
@3292 = ~If you're that anxious, you're bound to make a fool of yourself. Worse, this trip will be a waste we cannot afford.~
@3293 = ~I'm blind? By the gods, I AM blind! Keto! Where are you, Keto? I can't see you!~
@3294 = ~That's right. A willow in a rainstorm. I couldn't have put it better myself.~
@3295 = ~Then you're in real trouble. A willow in a rainstorm? That was the first silly thing that popped out of my mouth.~
@3296 = ~Great minds think alike, eh? But consider, Keto: true performers can channel that extra nervous energy into enlivening their performance.~
@3297 = ~They do, don't they? That may be why I can't stand still. Perhaps I have been kidding myself, living hand to mouth, town to town.~
@3298 = ~Mayhaps I am not a true performer, after all.~
@3299 = ~What do you mean?~
@3300 = ~You are treating this like a life-and-death situation, Keto. It's important, sure, but things are not so dire. It's just a competition, for Milil's sake!~
@3301 = ~You could have a good point there. If the world didn't have its second-rate hacks, how would we know who merits first class?~
@3302 = ~Of course you are a true performer! What about that trick you do with the wine bottle, two apples and a poison dart?~
@3303 = ~Of course you are a true performer! I love to hear you spin a tale, and I am not easily impressed.~
@3304 = ~With such a negative attitude, you are bound to fail in the competition. Worse, this trip will be a waste we cannot afford.~
@3305 = ~Not a true performer, not a true adventurer, what ARE you then?~
@3306 = ~You should know. Anyone could tell you have the gift. Blast you, you even sneeze in tune!~
@3307 = ~That may be why I can't stand still. Perhaps I have been kidding myself, living hand to mouth, town to town. Mayhaps I am not a true performer, after all.~
@3308 = ~Of course, you are a true performer! What about that trick you do with the wine bottle, two apples and a poison dart?~
@3309 = ~Remind me to never eat your campfire treats again, eh?~
@3310 = ~All kidding aside, why are you so nervous?~
@3311 = ~If you're that anxious, you are bound to make a fool of yourself come performance time. Worse, this trip will be a waste we cannot afford.~
@3312 = ~You'll eat my Roasted Bugs  la <CHARNAME>, and you'll like it!~
@3313 = ~Coming in first in an official competition... On the road, I've only my empty belly and purse to conquer. Winning such a grand thing, now THAT would put a song in my heart!~
@3314 = ~Err... a quiet song. Hardly noticeable. The kind that doesn't inspire company to throw things.~
@3315 = ~No, go ahead and sing loudly and clearly. My throwing arm could use the practice. I'll only use rocks smaller than my fist, I promise.~
@3316 = ~Yes. You do that. We get into enough rumbles without you inciting riots with that caterwaul.~
@3317 = ~Hey, you may not have the best voice in Amn, but no one can match your enthusiasm! I enjoy your singing!~
@3318 = ~See? I told you! You're excited, not nervous!~
@3319 = ~Wasted? A fine friend you are. I've an attack of stage fright, and all you can worry your stuffed head with is the cost of a prize I may or may not lose!~
@3320 = ~You misunderstand me, Keto. It will be a wasted trip if you spend the entire competition looking queasy instead of enjoying the experience. I referred to the price you are paying in your confidence.~
@3321 = ~Friends? Did I say we were friends?~
@3322 = ~But it is YOUR stage fright, Keto. Yours. How am I supposed to help you with that?~
@3323 = ~I am not travelling for my health, Keto. I need all the funds we can muster to help reach Imoen, so excuse me for looking at the big picture. That prize would make a difference.~
@3324 = ~I am not travelling for my health, Keto. We need all the funds we can muster if we're going to reach Irenicus for a reckoning. I am looking at the big picture: that prize would make a difference.~
@3325 = ~You ungrateful bitch! Irenicus stole my SOUL, remember? I am sacrificing time I cannot afford, but I came here with you anyway because I AM your friend. If you didn't come with the will to win, it is a waste. I won't apologize for that.~
@3326 = ~Yes. Your point being?~
@3327 = ~Pestered you, did I? Hmph. A small detour was so much to ask? 'Twas hardly the moon and the stars, you clock hog.~
@3328 = ~A couple of days out of <PRO_HISHER> way, <PRO_HESHE> begrudges me. Begrudges me, when it could bring me such joy.~
@3329 = ~A-ha! Now you find your spirit! See, Keto? If this competition is so important to you, don't let your nerves ruin it for you.~
@3330 = ~Make up your mind, Keto. Are you glad to be at this competition or not? If the pressure is taxing you, quit acting like it is my fault. If you are really happy to have this chance at glory, quit fretting about your nerves!~
@3331 = ~I am not travelling for my health, Keto. I need to reach Imoen; I don't have a couple of days to waste while you turn chicken in the face of a little competition.~
@3332 = ~I am not travelling for my health, Keto. Irenicus is due a reckoning for what he has wrought. I don't have couple of days to postpone tracking him down while you turn chicken in the face of a little competition.~
@3333 = ~That's true, <CHARNAME>. I've plied tales before many an audience: a disenchanted mob in Trademeet, the drunken regulars at the Sea's Bounty, a deaf man named Bob on the road to Nashkel... every one of them I brought around to a smile and filling my purse with a coin or two. But this...~
@3334 = ~Were I to run that low on wine... erm, well, some things are just too horrific to contemplate, eh? Better to chase the trouble into the open or banish it from your thoughts altogether. That certainly puts my situation into perspective. Thanks to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@3335 = ~I am not sure that was exactly the perspective I wanted you to see.~
@3336 = ~You're welcome to my, ah, wisdom.~
@3337 = ~Huh? What did I say?~
@3338 = ~But you said you were nervous about the competition. How did I help?~
@3339 = ~What was the question, again?~
@3340 = ~Bah, what a dull world it would be if a beggar mattered to me as much as a teapot. Sometimes I think you have an iron heart, <CHARNAME>, to show such uncaring to the people marching at your side.~
@3341 = ~Heh. You should have received the invitation to this contest, <CHARNAME>. Everyone loves a dedicated fool.~
@3342 = ~I was just trying to lighten the mood. What's troubling you?~
@3343 = ~I'd rather be a beloved fool than a yammering bore any day. Speaking of, what's your trouble?~
@3344 = ~No, I really am blind. You know what you said about dust? Grit, right in the peepers. Tell me of your troubles while I rinse them clean, eh?~
@3345 = ~I never said trouble wasn't hounding me. I'm burdened, sure enough.~
@3346 = ~A lucky coincidence, for I've next to nothing to pay you with.~
@3347 = ~All jesting aside, <CHARNAME>, do you have a minute to hear me out?~
@3348 = ~Sure, what is troubling you?~
@3349 = ~That depends. You know, people are always asking my opinion, and I don't necessarily--~
@3350 = ~No, I'd rather enjoy a spate of silence for a change.~
@3351 = ~(sigh) Can't we jest a little more instead?~
@3352 = ~And they'd probably be worth a silver for every syllable coming from the likes of you, if I had the coin to pay for it.~
@3353 = ~You're of the trade, <CHARNAME>, do you have a minute to hear me out, travelling muse to travelling muse?~
@3354 = ~This competition. I've never been a part of such a thing before. How do I go about it? 'Tis a funny thing; I've never found myself tongue tied. But now, with this contest nigh, I think of a thousand stories that need telling, a jamboree of words crammed in my head as surely as my flint and spade mashed against my bedroll in my pack.~ [FWKETOH7]
@3355 = ~Were I a true performer, shouldn't I have some great troubadour instinct guiding my lips to form something other than sputters of confusion?~ [FWKETOH8]
@3356 = ~All the tools I have at my disposal, stories of every disposition, subjects far and wide, and I'm stymied for which to pick. A bar crowd, 'cept for the most unreasonable, wants to make merry. A little laughter, a little glamour: that's all they need to favor you. Street crowds, they're achin' for stories of the common man making good. Give them a little heroism in an unexpected place, make a rich bastard look foolish: they're putty in your hands.~ [FWKETOH9]
@3357 = ~Judges...I don't know what to do with that audience, and I've got to figure it out if I'm going to win them over in this challenge. A thousand stories that need speaking, <CHARNAME>, and not a word in my head for which is the best to hear. What tale do you tell a judge that they've not encountered before?~ [FWKETOI0]
@3358 = ~Why not speak of what you have seen travelling with me? Sure, there are rumors of my deeds up and down the Sword Coast, but no other bard competing here has been right there on the front line with me!~
@3359 = ~It does not matter which story you tell, as long as you believe in it. If you feel the worth of the tale in your heart, your account will sell itself.~
@3360 = ~Talk about something you know... like yourself. Tell the judges your own story. It's not like they will be familiar with it.~
@3361 = ~Ach, you speak sense, <CHARNAME>, but my worry still weighs heavily.~
@3362 = ~Not a bit of compassion in you, even in your littlest toe! Ah, I've no grief to spare the cruel claptrap that leaves your mouth. I'll leave you to talk to yourself.~
@3363 = ~Oh, no, I couldn't. What that trick lacks in good taste it makes up for in stupidity, and I'd hate to be known as "Keto, the Poisoned Bard."~
@3364 = ~I... I don't know, <CHARNAME>.~
@3365 = ~That's my problem. I don't know who I am, or what drives me. I'm trying to remember, to decide, but everything keeps coming up another jumbled, "I don't know." Augggh! It's enough to make a woman scream!~
@3366 = ~They're crunchy, I'll give you that.~
@3367 = ~(sigh) I know you're trying to stay lighthearted, <CHARNAME>, but I just can't muster the farce. My worry about the contest weighs heavily.~
@3368 = ~You don't have to rub my face in it.~
@3369 = ~As fine as it is to daydream about a victory, my worry about the contest still weighs heavily.~
@3370 = ~No offense, <CHARNAME>, but you're hardly the average audience. My singing's best muffled, where it won't incite riots among the ordinary populace.~
@3371 = ~Aye, there is excitement. There's a fire in my blood when I start to spin a legend, but the nerves? I can't deny them. The anxiety is there as surely as the thrill.~
@3372 = ~A mixed blessing if I ever heard one, you gravel-mongering brute.~
@3373 = ~(sigh) It hardly matters to speak of singing in victory when my concern about the contest still weighs so heavily.~
@3374 = ~I--I beg your pardon, <CHARNAME>?!? You...~
@3375 = ~...Ach, you have a point. Shouldn't accuse you of greedy thoughts when I know what's on the line. I wager my worry has clouded my good sense and, aye, scoured at my confidence a wee bit.~
@3376 = ~Either my hearing must be faulty, or my imagination overblown. I thought we were friends. Sometimes I think you have an iron heart, <CHARNAME>, to show such uncaring to the people walking beside you. Ah, forget I bothered speaking to you of my worries.~
@3377 = ~I spoke hastily, and I beg your pardon for accusing you of greedy thoughts. You have your own burdens that drive you onward, and here I am, truly clucking like a chicken. This contest... it's muddled my good sense!~
@3378 = ~Ah, you mean well, friend, but I cannot resolve to shut down my anxiety as if it were last call.~
@3379 = ~You make me sound like a confused harridan! Well, you're half-right. I am confused.~
@3380 = ~It wasn't so much, but enough to snap me to speaking. How silly to mull the problem in silence when talking is what's always suited me best! I suppose I let my worry fester quietly because it's great speech I have to make for the contest that has me yanking my hair out. Bear with me while I explain the root of my agitation?~
@3381 = ~I didn't ask one... yet. Are you paying attention?~
@3382 = ~Yes, I am. We were talking about your attack of nerves now the competition approaches.~
@3383 = ~To what?~
@3384 = ~Maybe I am. Maybe I'm not.~
@3385 = ~Bah, what a dull world it would be if a beggar mattered to me as much as a teapot. Sometimes I think you have an iron heart, <CHARNAME>, to show such uncaring to the people walking beside you.~
@3386 = ~Hmph. You don't really have a gracious way of asking what's on a person's mind, do you? I have half a notion to say nothing, but... well, saying nothing feels a bit unnatural.~
@3387 = ~Oh, don't use that bottle! That's more suited to roasting trolls, not rinsing your eyes. Here... here's your water skin, and a cloth.~
@3388 = ~While you're prone, I'll just continue on, shall I?~
@3389 = ~Then I won't bother you with my worries. I can't say I'm not disappointed. But, never mind, forget I chirped a word.~
@3390 = ~If you cannot spare another minute sharing a frank thought, so be it. I can't say I'm not disappointed. But, never mind, forget I chirped a word.~
@3391 = ~Either my hearing must be faulty, or my imagination overblown. I thought we were friends. Sometimes I think you have an iron heart, <CHARNAME>, to show such uncaring to the people walking beside you.~
@3392 = ~Ah, forget I bothered speaking to you of my worries.~
@3393 = ~Then I won't bother you with my worries. I can't say I'm not disappointed. But, never mind... Forget I chirped a word.~
@3394 = ~You're blinking funny.~
@3395 = ~Are your eyes sorted out now?~
@3396 = ~Yes. Thanks for the concern. What do you think of my suggestion?~
@3397 = ~Ow! No, it's going to take me a few more minutes. Stupid... Dusty... Umar... Hills... What do you think of my suggestion?~
@3398 = ~Ha! I fooled you! I was faking the entire time!~
@3399 = ~Not exactly the front lines for me, more the merry and unscathed reinforcements, but I see your point, friend. Aye, your idea has a merit to it.~
@3400 = ~I can wrap words a-plenty around a chronicle of your history, and your name is already whispered in every town. Any judge would surely clamour in a similar manner to hear the true tale of <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@3401 = ~Ha! What a simple solution you've given me, <CHARNAME>, but ne'er were truer words spoken.~
@3402 = ~I can see what you're getting at, <CHARNAME>. If I'm agitated, I should only speak of something I'm comfortable with. I should be fairly comfortable talking of myself... shouldn't I? Well, the parts I can recall, anyways.~
@3403 = ~Your idea is fair enough, <CHARNAME>, but something else has popped into my head, clear as Helm's bartab. I now know what story to tell. I'll be keeping it as a surprise. I've pestered you enough with my troubles; there's no need to spoil your entertainment as well.~
@3404 = ~I beg your pardon for misjudging your interest, <CHARNAME>. My dilemma, since you're such a good listener, is this:~
@3405 = ~To the words that are coming out of my... oh, never mind. I can tell I'll find a better salve for my worries in the bottom of my wine bottle.~
@3406 = ~Am I to tap my boot and watch the daisies grow while you riddle out that pickle jar you call a head? I can tell I'll find a better drowning for my worries in the bottom of my wine bottle. I'll leave you to your own gherkin company.~
@3407 = ~Bah! I don't know who's the bigger fool: you, for your flapjack ideas of friendship, or myself, for thinking I could discuss my worries with the likes of a pancake. I'll get more solid advice out of my wine bottle, I can tell.~
@3408 = ~Thank you, thank you. My nerves have settled now that I've settled upon a direction.~
@3409 = ~Ah, that's a sorrowful shame, <CHARNAME>. As for your suggestion, I can see what you're getting at, <CHARNAME>. Err, pardon the expression.~
@3410 = ~If I'm agitated, I should only speak of something I'm comfortable with. I should be fairly comfortable talking of myself... shouldn't I? Well, the parts I can recall, anyways.~
@3411 = ~Ah, that's a sorrowful shame, <CHARNAME>. As for your suggestion... Ha! What a simple solution! I should speak the tale I feel in my heart; ne'er were truer words spoken.~
@3412 = ~Ah, that's a sorrowful shame, <CHARNAME>. As for your suggestion, my place hasn't exactly been the front lines, more the merry and unscathed reinforcements, but I see your point, friend. Eh, pardon the expression.~
@3413 = ~Aye, your idea has a merit to it. I can wrap words a-plenty around a chronicle of your history, and your name is already whispered in every town. Any judge would surely clamour in a similar manner to hear the true tale of <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep.~
@3414 = ~Ah, that's a sorrowful shame, <CHARNAME>. As for your suggestion, your idea is fair enough, but something else has popped into my head, clear as Helm's bartab. I now know what story to tell. I'll be keeping it as a surprise. I've pestered you enough with my troubles; there's no need to spoil your entertainment as well.~
@3415 = ~As for you, 'twould be safer if you didn't wobble around freely until your vision is cleared. Try to not bump into any ogres, eh?~
@3416 = ~Are you looking at me?~ [PGSTAC01]
@3417 = ~Sorry. How rude of me to stare. Aren't you--~
@3418 = ~Huh?~
@3419 = ~What? Are you talking to me?~
@3420 = ~Pardon. I did not mean to intrude on your deep, alcohol-induced reverie.~
@3421 = ~Yes. Does it matter?~
@3422 = ~I thought I told you to piss off.~ [PGSTAC02]
@3423 = ~I'm not going to warn you again. Shove off!~ [PGSTAC03]
@3424 = ~That's it! Let's see how you heckle my lute upside your flapping tongue!~ [PGSTAC04]
@3425 = ~Nishe tah... shee you... haaagin. How's... howsa... ~ [PGSTAC05]
@3426 = ~Mmffffhh... Sorry about the boots, mate.~
@3427 = ~Right the first time. I'm Stacy Xyxius. The most righteous lute player both inside Amn and out. Of course you lot of losers have heard of me.~ [PGSTAC06]
@3428 = ~Sure, I have! Are you here for the bardic competition?~
@3429 = ~No, I mistook you for someone else. Are you here for the bardic competition?~
@3430 = ~Oh, no. I had you confused with a guy named Bruce. He owes me money, the bastard.~
@3431 = ~Stacy? Ha! Isn't that a girl's name?~
@3432 = ~Yeah, I'm talking to you, arse lint. I repeat: ARE... YOU... LOOKING... AT... ME?!?~
@3433 = ~Oh, yes, sorry. How rude of me to stare. Aren't you--?~
@3434 = ~Pardon me. I did not mean to intrude on your deep, alcohol-induced reverie.~
@3435 = ~You must be here for the bardic competition. There's poetry in your... breath.~
@3436 = ~Yeah, it matters. It matters because there are two sorts of bodies in this world: those looking to buy me another pint, and those looking for a fist in the face.~
@3437 = ~Err... so, can I get you a beer, Mr....?~
@3438 = ~A fist in the face? Oh, goody! Just what I have always wanted! Can I have two? Please?!~
@3439 = ~That is certainly an attitude that will win you friends and influence people.~
@3440 = ~You will have the honor to die by my hand now.~
@3441 = ~What if I am looking for neither?~
@3442 = ~Who in the Hells are you?~
@3443 = ~You sound awfully angry. Can't we just get along?~
@3444 = ~Yeah. Right. So piss off.~
@3445 = ~Right the second time, though I haven't played such a dump since Winthrop's in Candlekeep.~
@3446 = ~Hey! I know Winthrop! I won't tolerate slurs against him from some lout with breath like a baalor's latrine!~
@3447 = ~Hey! I'm from Candlekeep! Watch what you call a dump, girly-man!~
@3448 = ~Yes, I had almost forgotten what a dump Winthrop's was, especially on a six-day morning after the regiment had been paid.~
@3449 = ~The only reason Winthrop's was ever trashed was because I'd been there first.~
@3450 = ~I wish you the best of luck, then. Have an ale on me.~
@3451 = ~I wish you the best of luck, then. I'd buy you an ale, but my purse has cobwebs.~
@3452 = ~I wish you the best of luck, then, and I leave you to your drinking.~
@3453 = ~You will need some luck, then. There's some mighty stiff competition among the bards here, my compatriots included.~
@3454 = ~Believe it, sunshine.~ [PGSTAC07]
@3455 = ~Now piss off.~ [PGSTAC08]
@3456 = ~Bruce? What kind of poncey name is Bruce?~
@3457 = ~Anyways, I'm not Bruce, right? So piss off.~
@3458 = ~Stacy Xyxius is the name. The most righteous lute player both inside Amn and out. Now why don't you posies either spread the word, or top off my mug of ale?~
@3459 = ~Posy? Who are you calling a posy? I'm not the one sporting a girl's name.~
@3460 = ~Posy? Who are you calling a posy? You have a girlier name than I do!~
@3461 = ~How about I bust that mug over your head, you lummox?~
@3462 = ~Sure, have an ale on me.~
@3463 = ~I'd buy you an ale, but my purse has cobwebs.~
@3464 = ~Sure. I'll just move along now, shall I?~
@3465 = ~You are in Imnesvale for the invitational? You will need some luck, in that case. There's some mighty stiff competition among the bards here, my compatriots included.~
@3466 = ~What if I don't wish to do either?~
@3467 = ~You can have a right hook, a left jab and a lute up your backside! No one mouths Stacy and stays standing!~
@3468 = ~What? What?! Are you mocking my good name?!~
@3469 = ~Damn straight, and fair enough. Maybe you're not the bag of pus I thought at first sight. Drink while your trousers are clean, mate. So says Stacy Xyxius.~
@3470 = ~Then you can piss off.~
@3471 = ~A bloody cheapskate's more like it. Piss off.~
@3472 = ~Thanks, mate. Maybe you're not the bag of pus I thought at first sight. Cheers.~
@3473 = ~Leaving? Without buying me a round? Luck's my arse. Piss off.~
@3474 = ~In that case, do me a favor...~
@3475 = ~Piss off.~
@3476 = ~No. Now, piss off.~
@3477 = ~How about I bite off your ears?~
@3478 = ~No, it's not. Stacy is a manly name, and anyone who says different can have their kidneys for breakfast.~
@3479 = ~I hate to argue, but I'm pretty sure Stacy is a name mostly used for girls.~
@3480 = ~Sure, sure. Stacy is SUCH a manly name. (snicker)~
@3481 = ~Whatever you say, honeylamb.~
@3482 = ~All right. I believe you.~
@3483 = ~Stacy is the girliest of all girly-man names that I have ever heard, you doily stitcher, and anyone who says different can try to feed me my kidneys for breakfast.~
@3484 = ~Lies! Lies! Stacy is a girl's name! You're a girl!~
@3485 = ~Yeah? Well, I like to argue. WITH MY FISTS.~
@3486 = ~Are you patronizing me? There's more than biscuits in my trousers! Watch your mouth!~
@3487 = ~Sorry. I shall just be moving along, then.~
@3488 = ~I apologize. That was uncalled for. Let me make amends by buying you an ale.~
@3489 = ~I apologize. That was uncalled for. I would make amends by buying you an ale, but my purse has cobwebs.~
@3490 = ~You've got biscuits in your trousers? Don't the crumbs itch?~
@3491 = ~Damn straight it's manly, so you just straighten up your sloppy mouth.~
@3492 = ~Just so we've got that straight. Now piss off.~
@3493 = ~Then fists up, whelp. I guess it's feeding time.~
@3494 = ~That's it! I'm popping your head like a melon!~
@3495 = ~That's the way to tell him, <CHARNAME>!~
@3496 = ~Oh. He, um. He looks kinda mad.~
@3497 = ~Hmph. Some kind of gratitude, after everything Winthrop did for you and me.~
@3498 = ~Awww, I think you hurt the little girl's feelings.~
@3499 = ~Bwahahah!~
@3500 = ~Hey! Looks aren't everything! But then, I bet you're already familiar with that saying.~
@3501 = ~You'll be seeing stars if you don't shut it, girl.~
@3502 = ~Oh, ho! More travelers! 'Tis an exciting time in this wooded haven! One can truly be proud to be a bard in Imnesvale this day!~ [PGPENN01]
@3503 = ~Who are you?~
@3504 = ~Say, fella, buy a <MANWOMAN> a drink?~
@3505 = ~Are you always this jovial?~
@3506 = ~Aye, it is important that the arts flourish in even the smallest of hamlets and dales.~
@3507 = ~Really? I wouldn't know. I'm more in to beating my armor back into shape than keeping a beat.~
@3508 = ~Really? I wouldn't know. The only music I have a use for comes in a hymnal.~
@3509 = ~Really? I wouldn't know, though making a living on the stage seems like a pretty good con.~
@3510 = ~Really? I wouldn't know. I'm pretty partial to the artistry of nature.~
@3511 = ~Really? I wouldn't know. The arts I concern myself with are less emotive and unfettered. Bards, in my experience, are creatures of extremes.~
@3512 = ~Really? I wouldn't know. I'm more into spells than sonnets.~
@3513 = ~Oh, ho! More travelers! 'Tis an exciting time in this wooded haven! One can truly be proud to be a bard in Imnesvale this night!~ [PGPENN99]
@3514 = ~My pleasure, friend! Let the songs ring and the ale flow this glorious <DAYNIGHT>!~ [GAM_07]
@3515 = ~Ah, a fellow bard! A pearl to you, good <SIRMAAM>!~
@3516 = ~I am unfamiliar with your craft as well. I am a lover, not a fighter. A pearl to you, good <SIRMAAM>!~
@3517 = ~By Milil, many a sweet hymn brings ambrosia to the ear. A pearl to you, good <SIRMAAM>!~
@3518 = ~'Tis no act, my friend. Every word from my lips is as sincere and true as rays from the sun. A pearl to you, good <SIRMAAM>!~
@3519 = ~Ah, without passion, friend, I would be poor company, but I do not begrudge you your temperance. A pearl to you, good <SIRMAAM>!~
@3520 = ~Music is magic, my friend. Music is magic! To sing a spell courts the beauty of the Weave. A pearl to you, good <SIRMAAM>!~
@3521 = ~Oh, no! I would not wish to blemish their dainty hands! Clapping is exertion enough!~
@3522 = ~Ah, you are a sight for sore eyes, and good company! Come, sit a spell. Let me buy you an ale as a show of friendship!~ [PGPENN05]
@3523 = ~Sure!~
@3524 = ~I would enjoy the company, but I shall stick to water, thanks.~
@3525 = ~Sorry, I just noticed someone I really need to talk to way, way away from this table. Sorry!~
@3526 = ~Do I look like a cheap drunk to you?~
@3527 = ~By all means, have water in the stead of wine. I admire your wisdom, friend. Truly, the exchange of wit and cameraderie is more intoxicating than evermead!~
@3528 = ~Perish the thought!~
@3529 = ~No, no! I AM a cheap drunk! Pour me a tall one, Penny!~
@3530 = ~Right, I'm a drunk with excellent taste. No cracks in my tankard, please.~
@3531 = ~Yes, perish the thought. Right after we have one teensy drink more.~
@3532 = ~Exactly. Not a drop shall pass betwixt my lips, no matter the kind offer. I would not mind the company, though.~
@3533 = ~Truthfuly, I have already downed my share. Any more libations, and the only thing I shall be keeping company with is a latrine!~
@3534 = ~Well said. I admire your temperance, friend. Truly, the exchange of wit and cameraderie is more intoxicating than evermead!~
@3535 = ~A wise <PRO_MANWOMAN> knows <PRO_HISHER> limits. Bravo!~
@3536 = ~My name is Pendragon Madrigal, though my fans call me Penny for short, the cheeky minxes.~ [PGPENN02]
@3537 = ~Poppy, he's talking about us!~ [PGGMIO08]
@3538 = ~He knows we exist!~ [PGPOPP01]
@3539 = ~HE LOVES US!~ [PGGROU01]
@3540 = ~Such bouncy beauties make a troubadour glad to get up in the morning!~
@3541 = ~I think it's disgusting the way they cling to you. It's unnatural to show such slavish devotion.~
@3542 = ~I need some groupies, if only to carry my extra gear.~
@3543 = ~Forsooth, I have no cause to express sorrow save a poverty of love. As you can see, my bounty overflows!~ [PGPENN03]
@3544 = ~Is he talking about us?~ [PGPOPP02]
@3545 = ~He is! We're his bounty!~ [PGGMIO09]
@3546 = ~(sigh)~ [PGPOPP03]
@3547 = ~(sigh)~ [PGGMIO10]
@3548 = ~He's so dreamy!~ [PGGROU02]
@3549 = ~I am a lucky, lucky man.~
@3550 = ~Ah, you show great wisdom. Never is a lass more lovely than when adorned with flowers in her hair and dressed in dew. Nature is the artist supreme!~ [PGPENN04]
@3551 = ~I saw a patch of violets and featheril out back. Let's grab them!~ [PGGMIO11]
@3552 = ~Let's! But how do we dress in dew?~ [PGPOPP04]
@3553 = ~I think that means NAKED.~ [PGGMIO12]
@3554 = ~Oh, naughty!~ [PGPOPP05]
@3555 = ~Naughty!~ [PGGMIO13]
@3556 = ~(giggles)~ [PGGROU03]
@3557 = ~Ha! Ha! A pearl to you, good <SIRMAAM>!~
@3558 = ~I cannot help it if the lasses fall in love with me. I am the lucky slave, for I live to be blessed by their sweet accolades.~
@3559 = ~He's so romantic!~
@3560 = ~A flower for you, stunning creature.~
@3561 = ~For me? Oh, no. No, I couldn't accept such a thing.~
@3562 = ~Then I shall bask in its sweet fragrance and think of you.~
@3563 = ~What's he see in her?~
@3564 = ~Yeah!~
@3565 = ~Oh. That's too bad. Do stop by later, if I'm not otherwise entertained.~
@3566 = ~(giggles)~
@3567 = ~Look! There's Penny Madrigal! I'm his biggest fan!~ [PGPOPP07]
@3568 = ~No, you aren't! I am!~ [PGGMIO00]
@3569 = ~No, I am!~
@3570 = ~Oh, Penny Madrigal! I just love him!~ [PGGMIO01]
@3571 = ~So do I!~ [PGPOPP08]
@3572 = ~But I love him more!~
@3573 = ~No, you don't!~
@3574 = ~I've drunk HALF a beer. Oooh, the room is spinning!~ [PGGMIO05]
@3575 = ~That's nay drinking, ye reedy limbed spewling! Get half a barrel in yer gullet, then we'll talk drinking!~
@3576 = ~(hic)~
@3577 = ~I just know Penny's going to take me home tonight. I just KNOW it!~ [PGGMIO07]
@3578 = ~You... you haven't seen my mother looking for me, have you?~ [PGPOPP09]
@3579 = ~Oh, pardon me! I must be in your way.~ [PGPOPP10]
@3580 = ~Do my eyes deceive me? Nalia de'Arnise! Truly, I did not expect to find anyone of refinement in this ditchwater backwoods.~ [PGJOUL05]
@3581 = ~Oh, dear.~
@3582 = ~<CHARNAME>, that is Sir Joules, one of Aunty's dearest chums. He's more of a gentleman bard than a singing journeyman. I have never seen him perform where he wasn't also feasting on beef and custard at the head table. I cannot imagine he would want to be here!~
@3583 = ~Hmm. Now that I have had a closer look at you, Nalia, I mark that you have gone distinctly untidy. What would dear Delcia think?~
@3584 = ~Rips and wrinkles, dirt of the road... By the Gods, girl! Have you been traveling on FOOT?~
@3585 = ~Do not look so surprised, Sir Joules. The majority of people are not in your position, venturing out of their cozy fortresses only when hot wine and a gilded carriage are available.~
@3586 = ~Dear girl, do not lecture me on the nature of commoners. They are squirming enough out of the woodwork to witness already! If they were not so inferior, they would be neither grubby, nor engage in belching contests. Show me a farmer in silk, and I shall say, "There's a man I can respect!"~
@3587 = ~(sigh) What brings you here, Sir Joules? This is obviously not your preferred sort of gathering.~
@3588 = ~True, true. The accommodations are quite dreadful, but Lord Lynnwick was there when I received my invitation. He gambled I couldn't cut the mustard among these heathens, and by Tymora, I am not a man to pass up a gentlemanly wager!~
@3589 = ~Now, be a good girl, Nalia. Run along and wash your face. You don't want me reporting to Lady Delcia that you were roaming about in public unkempt, what?~
@3590 = ~Yes, Sir Joules. I certainly don't want THAT.~
@3591 = ~I declare, my veggie tray was a complete disaster!~ [PGJOUL01]
@3592 = ~I specifically asked for yellow roses in my room, not plum blossoms. Where are the servants? I implore you!~ [PGJOUL02]
@3593 = ~No autographs, please. My wrist is fatigued from the strain.~ [PGJOUL03]
@3594 = ~I care not for this wilderness. Why, I've mud on my velvet pantaloons!~ [PGJOUL04]
@3595 = ~Woo! Chug-a-lug! Get a load of that slice of crusty loaf! Smear 'im in jam and butter, and I'll have me a nibble, I will!~ [PGFRIL01]
@3596 = ~So sorry to scramble when we've just met, dearie, but when a lass sees an arse that needs pinching, what's ta do but answer the call?~ [PGFRIL02]
@3597 = ~I say! I shall not stand tweaking by strangers! Show yourself!~ [PGJOUL06]
@3598 = ~I'll show ye me face and more, you yummy man. How's about we play "Find the Pillow" down by the willows?~
@3599 = ~Why, you are a comely little thing, and your speech is... fascinating. Perhaps we could touch foreheads over a glass of Arabellan wine, and you can describe these willows to me in more detail.~
@3600 = ~Peachy, luv! Yer lap or mine?~
@3601 = ~Don't be shy, dearie. I'm not! Grab yer sweetie by the rumple and give 'em a squeeze! Woo!~ [PGFRIL03]
@3602 = ~Oh make my grave
Large, white and deep
Put a marble stone
At my head and feet
And in the middle
Put a turtledove
That the world may know
I died for love.~ [PGPRU01]
@3603 = ~Oh, no!~ [FWKETOI1]
@3604 = ~Bartender, pour three more! Might as well be without a leg to stand on in this contest literally, as well as figuratively.~ [FWKETOI2]
@3605 = ~What are you talking about?~
@3606 = ~Wow. That girl is really good. She looks harmless enough; let's go talk to her.~
@3607 = ~Will you quit fretting? It's talking all the fun out of my carousing.~
@3608 = ~Words. They stream from your lips, and yet they mean nothing.~
@3609 = ~Pardon my quiet. I do not talk much. I am more comfortable with my songs for company.~ [PGPRU06]
@3610 = ~Ah, you stand with the pride of a hero. Is there a song about you?~ [PGPRU07]
@3611 = ~I beg your pardon. I'm always saying hen-witted things.~ [PGPRU08]
@3612 = ~Why would you want to talk to me? I... I'm not adept at conversation.~ [PGPRU09]
@3613 = ~I'll tell you what I'm talking about.~
@3614 = ~Of course she's good. Of course you want to talk to her. That's Prudence.~
@3615 = ~I can't help but fret! SHE'S here!~
@3616 = ~I'll tell you what I mean.~
@3617 = ~Prudence Dubhthistle. For all purposes, a quiet maid from Sembia who's never said, "Boo!" to a puppy. You'd forget she was there, that she ever existed, if she didn't start strumming a tune, open up her mouth, and sing!~
@3618 = ~Prudence Dubhthistle. Well-mannered, mild-tempered, the sweetest girl one could hope to have for company. I would have to beg and pester for engagements at taverns, spending most of my pay in the form of the bar tab to get in good with the management.~
@3619 = ~Prudence, she just smiles meekly at an innkeep, and they're pleading with her to take their gold and stay forever!~
@3620 = ~She sounds diabolically nice. Before you know it, street urchins subjected to her infamy will start using words like "please" and "thank you"! She must be stopped before it is too late!~
@3621 = ~You look a little green there, friend.~
@3622 = ~Everyone can't be as opinionated as you, Keto. Maybe people find appeal in her shy demeanor.~
@3623 = ~She sounds disgustingly appealing. Quick, let's move away before we have to talk to her.~
@3624 = ~Quit teasing me. You just don't get it. People naturally adore Prudence. She sings, and beggars give HER their coppers.~
@3625 = ~I AM a little jealous. The talent seems so much easier for her. She hardly has to try.~
@3626 = ~It's a small comfort to say I'm more of an adventurer than she'll ever be, even if I don't measure up as much of an adventurer. That's not going to decide this competition.~
@3627 = ~If you like her so much, why don't you go talk to her instead?~
@3628 = ~Yes, I think I will.~
@3629 = ~No, it looks like she's recognized you and wants to chat.~
@3630 = ~No, I was just teasing you. I'd rather have an ale and hear another one of your tales.~
@3631 = ~I didn't say I liked her. I was simply trying to help you understand why some people might dislike YOU.~
@3632 = ~I'm not critcizing Prudence. No, no, no. She's very likeable, really. She makes me feel...~
@3633 = ~Like less of a bard in comparison. Oh, I need a drink. Bartender!~
@3634 = ~Whew, you had me nervous for a second. Not that I'm critcizing Prudence, no, no. She's very likeable, really. She makes me feel...~
@3635 = ~Like less of a bard in comparison. Come! Drinks and stories on me, my friend!~
@3636 = ~Thanks for your insight. Pfeh. I bet that before you remove the hook from a fish, you twist it a little, right?~
@3637 = ~If Prudence has been invited to this contest, the best I can hope for is she'll perform a dirge, and the judges will pass away in empathy before they can crown her. She's just too... too... sweet to resist!~
@3638 = ~Keto? Keto Riven, is that you?~ [PGPRU05]
@3639 = ~Last I checked.~
@3640 = ~It is a relief to see a friendly face! So many people have come to this tiny village; some of them are quite grand! I dare not speak to them. What would ordinary folk such as I say to bards of such renown?~
@3641 = ~And, surprise, you had no such trouble saying "hi" to me.~
@3642 = ~You always know what to say, Keto. You never seem wary of talking to anyone. This competition must be a delight for you, so many new faces, and every one with glories to boast!~
@3643 = ~If I could be more like you... but the crowd is so overwhelming.~
@3644 = ~You're confident enough when you sing. Merchants stop in their tracks and open their purses out of reflex.~
@3645 = ~You exaggerate. I'm not so skilled as that. When I sing, though, I forget that there's an audience staring, expecting me to say something clever or dazzle them with music.~
@3646 = ~This contest is really made for people like you, a dashing adventurer, not a cowardly simple village girl like me. You'll spin one of your fascinating legends or witty yarns, and you'll reign victorious, I'm sure.~
@3647 = ~That's... that's not exactly how I see things unfolding, but it's heartening to hear that conclusion come from your lips.~
@3648 = ~Ach, Pru, you sell yourself short. You must know people clamour to hear you play a song.~
@3649 = ~I am a copper-a-dozen lass with a lute. It's the songs that make the magic, not me.~
@3650 = ~I could say the same for myself and my stories.~
@3651 = ~Your tales may concern other folk, but the words are your own. Ach, you sell yourself short, Keto.~
@3652 = ~But hear me blathering on. It's time I escape this bustle and retire to the quiet of my room. I'll leave you to the company of your friends.~
@3653 = ~So long, Pru. I'm... I'm glad you spotted me.~
@3654 = ~Barry, there are commoners speaking to me.~ [PGLYR01]
@3655 = ~I'm sure they are just fans, Lyrica. Don't get excited. Let them tell you how fabulous you are, and they will go away.~ [PGBARR01]
@3656 = ~Can you not make them go away now? I am an artist, Barry. My creative aura is a fragile butterfly. I cannot have creatures in dirty jerkins with drool on their chins panting at me with fawning gratitude for my existence! It's too much to expect! My butterfly is FRAGILE!~ [PGLYR02]
@3657 = ~I... I WANT TO BE ALONE!~ [PGLYR03]
@3658 = ~Come 'ere, champ. Let's you and me have a chat, away from the ears of the lady.~ [PGBARR02]
@3659 = ~Who is that woman, and what was she shrieking about?~
@3660 = ~What lady? All I see is a diva needing a spanking, and I am just the <PRO_MANWOMAN> to give it!~
@3661 = ~You should not crowd me, friend. I am not a sheep to be herded afield.~
@3662 = ~Is that Lyrica? THE LYRICA? I saw her perform a few years ago in Candlekeep. She's perfection! Sorry, sorry. I did not mean to trouble her.~
@3663 = ~I feel your pain, buddy, trust me. I tithe to Ilmater every morning and night for the patience to withstand that harpy. It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it.~
@3664 = ~But... who is she?~
@3665 = ~So who are you? What's your job?~
@3666 = ~Your problems are not my concern. I have seen enough of the pair of you.~
@3667 = ~Wait--is that Lyrica? THE LYRICA? I saw her perform a few years ago in Candlekeep. She's perfection! Sorry, sorry. I did not mean to trouble her.~
@3668 = ~She's Lyrica. THE Lyrica. She likes to spread around the rumor that she is Oghma's granddaughter by a wood nymph thrice-removed, but, trust me, I knew her when she was a cobbler's youngest working tables at The Cock and Bull in Cedarspoke.~ [PGBARR03]
@3669 = ~I have the dubious, yet profitable, pleasure of being Lyrica's agent. I arrange her performances, accommodations, and everything in between. She doesn't sneeze without me getting my ten percent. Literally.~
@3670 = ~From playing amphitheaters in Waterdeep to private audiences in Calimport, that bird's songbox makes me a fortune. So what if she's a bit moody? I'm crying backstage, but I'm laughing all the way to the vault.~
@3671 = ~Most places, it's a breeze to meet her demands. Here, in this wagon-rut of a town, I'm at my wit's end. Crazily enough, Lyrica was set on travelling to this contest in the backwoods in the beginning.~
@3672 = ~The master of ceremonies is what she calls "the right people." She's a sucker for anyone who plays with demigods, if you know what I mean. A regular social climber.~
@3673 = ~Now that the duchess is on the scene, the Imnesvale rural charm is grating on her nerves. I tell ya, she's got plenty of nerves to grate. Every crumb of her whims that I can satisfy keeps me that much farther away from my diva stomping out of town before she wins me my cut of the prize.~
@3674 = ~Nothing personal, champ, but she's taken a dislike to the look of you. How's about you make her happy, and I make it worth your while? Here's fifty gold. Give Lyrica a wide berth, eh, pal?~
@3675 = ~Why, I've never been so insulted! I am not rabble to be paid off with a few paltry coins!~
@3676 = ~Wait--that's Lyrica? THE LYRICA? I saw her perform a few years ago in Candlekeep. She's perfection! Sorry, sorry. I did not mean to trouble her.~
@3677 = ~All right! Fifty gold! I'll see you later, chump!~
@3678 = ~I suppose I could give Lyrica her space, since she seems so disturbed. I am happy to do it for free, however.~
@3679 = ~Make it 100, and I'm history.~
@3680 = ~You might as well let your diva leave town. She doesn't stand a chance against the competition.~
@3681 = ~Hey, I can't blame you for wanting to get a bit closer to the lady if you're fans. She's just tense with the competition coming up. An artist, you ken? Here, have one of her autographed handprints on me. A real collector's item!~
@3682 = ~Fine, fine. I'm not meaning to rub you the wrong way, but it seems Lyrica has taken to dislike you on sight. She's very sensitive that way. An artist, you ken?~
@3683 = ~How's about a whole bunch of paltry coins? I'll give you 150 if you scram.~
@3684 = ~No, I am still insulted. Just you wait! I'll have the world know what kind of people you and Lyrica are!~
@3685 = ~150? Yes, that's a much more flattering payoff. I'll take it.~
@3686 = ~Begone! I am not one to be bribed!~
@3687 = ~Listen, pal, we got ways of dealing with that, too. Why don't you take this nice autographed handprint, and have a few drinks on me. It'll be easier that way.~
@3688 = ~You'll scram for FREE? What a chump--I mean, you sure are kind, my <LADYLORD>. It's an honor to see the back of you!~
@3689 = ~A fair deal. Sorry if there's any insult, pal. Lyrica's just tense with the competition coming up. An artist, you ken? There's your 100 gold. Don't spend it all in one place!~
@3690 = ~A wise guy, eh? Hmph. Everyone's a critic. Just juggle your fat opinions somewhere else, pal. Meh.~
@3691 = ~Why do I not have a private drawing room? I always have a private drawing room away from the rabble!~ [PGLYR04]
@3692 = ~Barry? Barry! Why wasn't that in my contract? Why don't I have my private drawing room?!~ [PGLYR05]
@3693 = ~You don't have a contract. This is a competition, remember?~ [PGBARR04]
@3694 = ~Of course, I remember it is a competition! I was simply testing you.~
@3695 = ~You're getting a bit rusty, Barry. I'm beginning to wonder if you're worth your ten percent. Clavolio of Darromar says he'll do twice the promotion for only eight.~
@3696 = ~You gonna trust a guy named Clavolio over your old pal Barry? You wound me, duchess.~
@3697 = ~You are not going to make me feel guilty. I am suffering, do you understand? I am suffering without my private drawing room.~
@3698 = ~Take a look at this place, Lyr. Does it look like it has a private drawing room to you?~
@3699 = ~No. But the least you could have done was throw a peasant out of their house for me. One without a dirt floor... like the Mayor.~
@3700 = ~Psst. Barry!~ [PGLYR06]
@3701 = ~What's it now, duchess?~ [PGBARR05]
@3702 = ~I can feel EYES on me. One of those beady stares of the obsessed.~ [PGLYR07]
@3703 = ~Are you sure? The last two times it was just that mirror hanging on the wall...~ [PGBARR06]
@3704 = ~BARRY!~
@3705 = ~I don't think you are taking my safety seriously. I am a fabulous, famous woman. Thousands would starve for the chance to hear me sing. My fans are devoted, and with devotion, comes stalkers.~
@3706 = ~Sure, it starts with a bit of feverish ogling in a public house, but give them a little encouragement, next thing you know the weirdos are writing poems about your brain on a plate and sending you their pantaloons.~
@3707 = ~Boo!~
@3708 = ~Would you autograph my pantaloons, ma'am?~
@3709 = ~Lady, you are delusional.~
@3710 = ~Oh no! She's STARING at me again! Why won't she stop staring at me?!~
@3711 = ~(Yawn.)~
@3712 = ~Save me, Barry! SAVE ME!!! IT SPEAKS!!~
@3713 = ~Didn't I tell you, Barry? That <PRO_MANWOMAN> is obviously mad. Quick, block their insane rampage with your body while I hide.~
@3714 = ~BARRY! IT'S TALKING TO ME!! IT'S...~
@3715 = ~Oh, blast. I'm looking in the mirror again.~
@3716 = ~Don't touch the talent! Don't touch the talent!~ [PGLYR16]
@3717 = ~Can't help you, champ. Looking after Lyrica's a full-time responsibility.~ [PGBARR07]
@3718 = ~Of all the confounded... unbelievable wastes of...~ [FWKETOI3]
@3719 = ~AAAAAUGH! I BLEW IT, <CHARNAME>! It was all right there, and I blithered like a baby kobold! I meandered like a lost puppy! I... I...~ [FWKETOI4]
@3720 = ~I think you need to calm down, Keto. This is not the end of the world.~
@3721 = ~You will do better next time! These things happen to us! One cannot climb on the stage without catching the occasional splinter!~
@3722 = ~That was really atrocious. Have you learned nothing from me?~
@3723 = ~That was really atrocious. Are you sure you're a bard?~
@3724 = ~Wait, you mean you didn't do that on purpose? I thought you were just playing around.~
@3725 = ~Come on. Let's put some distance between us and this place. You will feel better once we get back on the road.~
@3726 = ~What?!? No! Of course not! You think I'd stand there and make a fool out of myself--out of both of us--on purpose?~
@3727 = ~I'll play the fool, <CHARNAME>, but not here. Not like this.~
@3728 = ~You don't understand. This was a real chance to shine. On my own, on a big stage, just me, just Keto, no one else overshadowing me.~
@3729 = ~And it turned into a disaster. A total, unmitigated disaster.~
@3730 = ~Ach, if it was only a tiny splinter, I'd ask you to pull it out and be done with it. This was a stake. A big wooden stake. May as well hand me a mallet and I'll finish driving it through my own heart.~
@3731 = ~We could, but that's not what I wanted. I wanted to plant my feet and say "Here I am, world! Here's what Keto's made out of!" and stop all the flitting about. Instead... well, it's back to the dirt trail.~
@3732 = ~But. You're right. I've lost nothing by this. It's... it's more practice. And I'll know better next year, eh?~
@3733 = ~So, let's back to the road, you and I. I'll try this story again someday on a smaller, less... less inquisitive audience.~
@3734 = ~Maybe not. I... oh, there's just no more words. I'm a failure. And I can't look you in the eye anymore after this.~
@3735 = ~I came to you with nothing, and that's how I'll leave. Sorry I slowed down your destiny.~
@3736 = ~Hurrah, Prudence! I'm happy for her! Really, I am!~
@3737 = ~We're only giving her the gold, mind you. Everything else is yours.~
@3738 = ~Everything else? Haven't you given me enough by being here?~
@3739 = ~Thank you! Thank you all for being here to see it... to see me! Actually do something right!~
@3740 = ~I only wish... Gods, to have lost a friend to regain a family, what a terrible choice.~
@3741 = ~There's more than gold, mind you.~
@3742 = ~Haven't you given me enough by being here?~
@3743 = ~Not nearly enough, our Caitie. For one, there's your Granny O'Fairney's cloak. She was a bit of a wild one in her day, and it came in quite handy when she was rousing the rabble. We would have given it to you before but--~
@3744 = ~Granny O'Fairney didn't want to stop using it as a tablecloth. There's not a gravy in Faerun that can touch it.~
@3745 = ~I have a grandmother, too?~
@3746 = ~Aye, back in Featherdale.~
@3747 = ~That was another part of the winning. We hoped that you would come home again. We've been parted for so long and so filled with worry, and you, with your troubled memory, could use a visit to the halls you grew up in, I'd say.~
@3748 = ~Home.~
@3749 = ~I could go home...~
@3750 = ~It would be just like you never left. The bad business with Aedan's death needn't haunt you anymore.~
@3751 = ~Aedan? I couldn't bring myself to ask, even though I thought I should, thought I should know the answer. Aedan was... my husband?~
@3752 = ~Now, don't fret yourself, Caitie. I want my girl as happy as she makes everyone else with her smiles and stories.~
@3753 = ~That's just it, Da. I haven't made everyone happy. What about Aedan? What if I was responsible...?~
@3754 = ~Oh, dearie, it'll do you no good to wonder the answers to questions there are no answers for. You may not remember it, but you loved that boy. You couldn't have been responsible. I don't care what the neighbors might say.~
@3755 = ~And even if you were responsible, you're our daughter. We love you regardless of crimes of passion.~
@3756 = ~Father, hush! Our babe didn't stab her fellow in the back!~
@3757 = ~Don't be getting hasty with your conclusions, Mother. Stranger things have happened in this wild, wicked world. Wives become sorely unhappy with their husbands all the time. Perhaps Aedan forgot her birthday.~
@3758 = ~I've forgotten my birthday!~
@3759 = ~...No.~
@3760 = ~No, I realize you mean well, and I truly do want to spend more time together... getting reacquainted. One day. Right now, it's too much for me.~
@3761 = ~Ma, Da... I can't go home again. I am your girl. I'm sure that I'm like you in more ways that I can't begin to recognize and count yet.~
@3762 = ~I'm sure I have a home in Featherdale that is part of me, too, but I can't pretend that I never left. That I was never married to a man whose name I've forgotten, who I may have killed. I can't wipe away the years I've wandered from town to town and all the things I've seen along the way. Those are also a part of who I am.~
@3763 = ~I can't stop running yet. I'm not ready yet, but when I am, I know where I'll go to stand still. When I'm ready, I'll go back to Featherdale.~
@3764 = ~But Caitie, we've just found ye!~
@3765 = ~Oh, Ma! Don't weep! It makes this so much harder! My friend, <CHARNAME>, has a long road ahead, and <PRO_HESHE> needs me to see it through. What's more, I need to see it through with <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@3766 = ~Tell you what... I'll write you, from the road like you said I did before. That is, if you aren't too disappointed. If you don't want to hear from me...~
@3767 = ~Never say such a thing. Ye need not ever be an orphan again, love. Of course your Mother and I would welcome your letters.~
@3768 = ~And maybe there's another gift we could be giving ye. The letters of your first journey, I've carried them since we first feared you lost. Now that you're found, I'll return them to you. You can tuck them in your pack, and read them when you are ready.~
@3769 = ~I will. Yes, I will.~
@3770 = ~I... I'm tongue-tied again. I don't know how to say goodbye.~ [FWKETOQ9]
@3771 = ~Just give us a kiss, keep your chin up, and walk away. Know this... Keto... you're just as you should be, and I'll thump any lunk who says differently.~ [PGDADC8]
@3772 = ~Thank you, Da. And you, Ma, thank you for the letters, and the cloak, and--~ [FWKETOQ0]
@3773 = ~Say nothing more, dearie, else I lose my resolve and convince your father we should beat the drum in your wake. Bless you, my girl. Bless you, and we'll be waiting.~ [PGMOMD8]
@3774 = ~Unbelievable. Just... unbelievable. And, Hells, if I knew just standing around telling my tale would conjure up my family, I'd have made it my bedtime prayer!~ [FWKETOI5]
@3775 = ~Probably gotten me further than the chime of all those last-call bells, that's for certain.~ [FWKETOI6]
@3776 = ~Unbelievable. Just... unbelievable. Makes me feel just a bit guilty to have won my family back with Yoshimo's blood, though. I hope he would understand.~ [FWKETOI7]
@3777 = ~I'm so glad you were here for this, <CHARNAME>. For all I know, I'd have fallen to pieces up there without your support. Means a lot, it does.~ [FWKETOI8]
@3778 = ~You probably should have left with them. I'm bored of you anyway.~
@3779 = ~I stand by my friends, Keto. It was truly an honor to see you reunited with your family.~
@3780 = ~I thought this would be a waste of time, honestly, but something good came out of it after all.~
@3781 = ~You probably should have left with them. They seem to care for you a great deal.~
@3782 = ~Oh? And just how MUCH does it mean to you? Enough to--~
@3783 = ~If you're trying to bring me down, <CHARNAME>, it won't work. Not today. Not with Granny's cloak on my back and Mother's blessing still ringing in my ears. Today, I could cross the Snowflakes jumping peak to peak.~
@3784 = ~Made it worth the journey, for sure. I'd have crawled to get here if I'd any idea what could happen!~
@3785 = ~Aye. Don't think a big part of me didn't want to. But that would have been too easy. The day will come.~
@3786 = ~Naught more than a hearty handshake, I think, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Let's not spoil the moment with crass thoughts, aye?~
@3787 = ~I always hoped that it would happen like this... that I wouldn't just find out where I came from and what happened to me, but that it would be a real event, with a... a celebration, and witnesses by the score!~
@3788 = ~I'm not even bothered in the slightest that Prudence won.~
@3789 = ~Well. Maybe a little. But Da's right, I got the prize that was really meant for me.~
@3790 = ~And I even won something! And don't give me that look--it was NOT just because I knew the judges. Da wouldn't have stood for that sort of thing anyway. At least... I don't think he would have.~
@3791 = ~There's still a lot I don't know. They're familiar to me, but my memories are still tenday-old stew left out in the rain--not worth much.~
@3792 = ~Knowing that someone else knows is a big improvement over stumbling around in the dark pretending to be somebody, though.~
@3793 = ~So do I call you Catriona now? Cait? Caitie?~
@3794 = ~Why not spend some time with them to bring up more of those memories?~
@3795 = ~They seem decent folk. Do you think they would adopt me as well? I could use a change of parentage.~
@3796 = ~Fine, fine. Just move.~
@3797 = ~My congratulations once again for everything. After you, Keto.~
@3798 = ~I don't know. I... I don't think so. "Riven" I can certainly do without, now that I know I've got something better.~
@3799 = ~But "Cait" still sounds strange to my ears, it does. Like a song I know I remember but can't recall a single note of. Maybe after the folks call me "our Cait" a few hundred more times, I'll get used to it.~
@3800 = ~But between you and me and the adoring masses, it'll be "Keto" for some time, I think.~
@3801 = ~There's a big dusty trunk full of memories in my head, <CHARNAME>. Today we cracked it open. If I just dumped it out on the floor, I might lose some of them.~
@3802 = ~And... and as much as I know we all love each other, I think the three of us need a little time to get used to this.~
@3803 = ~Besides. All that can wait. You can't, <CHARNAME>. Leaving your story now to pick up the pieces of the Girl Who Vanished wouldn't be a very smart move, now would it?~
@3804 = ~Do you want the poor people to keel over with exhaustion? One foundling per day's probably quite enough for them, I'd say.~
@3805 = ~I'll share the wine, <CHARNAME>, but if you don't mind... this prize, I think I'd like to keep for myself.~
@3806 = ~Aye. Well done, Keto. Congratulations, Keto. Glad you got the whole "mystery of your life" thing worked out, Keto.~
@3807 = ~Ah well. It's still one hell of a day!~
@3808 = ~Why, thank you, <CHARNAME>. Such chivalry. Might be good for both of us to do these competitions more often!~


// Journal stuff

@4000 = ~Keto's Competition.

Keto has received a very formal invitation to a bardic competition being held soon in the Umar Hills. She is desperate to participate in order to prove her worth as a storyteller, and asks that we travel there as soon as possible.~

@4001 = ~Keto's Competition.

We traveled to the Umar Hills for the bardic competition and it... did not go well. Keto was heckled off the stage and the contest prize was awarded to an unpleasant woman by the name of Lyrica. Keto is rather distraught.~

@4002 = ~Keto's Competition.

We traveled to the Umar Hills for the bardic competition. Keto performed quite well, although she did not win the contest. She did, however, discover that the contest was arranged by her family, who had feared her lost. They filled in a number of gaps as to her true identity, but she has elected to stay with me rather than return to the Featherdale homestead where she was raised.~

@4003 = ~Keto's Competition.

We traveled to the Umar Hills for the bardic competition. Keto performed exceptionally well, winning the crowd's approval and the contest's prize. More importantly, she discovered that the contest was arranged by her family, who had feared her lost. They filled in a number of gaps as to her true identity, but she has elected to stay with me rather than return to the Featherdale homestead where she was raised.~

@4004 = ~Keto's Competition.~
