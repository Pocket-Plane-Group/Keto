# Keto NPC MOD For Baldur's Gate 2
This mod adds a joinable NPC to Baldur's Gate II.

Keto is an NPC add-on for Baldur's Gate 2. A travelling storyteller, Keto has seen the front door of just about every dungeon in Amn, and seen the inside of even more taverns. An energetic young woman who has a love/hate relationship with adventuring (she loves adventure but hates the inevitable peril), Keto stumbles into the story of the Bhaalspawn while plying her trade in Athkatla's Five Flagons Inn.

The mod is directly compatible with all BG2 games: BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, EET.
